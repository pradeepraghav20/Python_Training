1t"My family had the best delivery driver experience ever on Easter of 2023. The pizza was incredible. The service was fast. I would give it a 20 star rating if I could. The driver was extremely polite. I have never had service like that in my life. I wish I got his name. Excellent service. Thanks Domino's."
2t"The Domino's in Tuscumbia, AL is by far the best anywhere around here! They have the best customer service and when I called about my missing pizza, the manager I spoke with, Leslie, was super nice and had no issues with correcting the mistake. I am a loyal customer for life thanks to her!"
3t"OH, this restaurant is So worth it. I mean listen. They put the most effort into their food than any other restaurant I have ever been to. The crust was nothing like ever before. You know Pizza Hut, they have crunchy regular crusts the boring part of the pizza oh but Domino's? It was crunchy on the outside and soft and delicious on the inside. The pepperoni was crunchy and flavorful. And Oh My Gosh the cinnamon twists dipped in the served icing was the best dessert,  completing perfect satisfaction to meet my requirements. And overall this fantastic restaurant is a must-go and I will forever eat there."
4t"I ordered stuffed cheesy bread for a change and it was absolutely worth of every penny! It was so cheesy and satisfying. The cheese was so stringy when you were taking pieces apart and was so satisfying. I absolutely recommend it to others. Their advertisement matches to the quality of their product. I bought it from 1171 Upper James location."
5t"Assistant was very Professional and understood my complaint to the fullest with no attitude…Got right to the problem at hand and rectified the situation without it going overboard or to the next level, my problem was heard and not just given attitude, very, very Professional. 10/10 that that she resolved my problem and rectified the situation without further speaking to a higher figure!"
6t"For the second time in the history of New Castle, IN’s luxury offerings, the city has opened another Domino’s Pizza restaurant (not since 199x has the city had a Domino’s). And though this new Domino’s started out actually putting an effort into making quality food, it has quickly gone downhill in the few months it has been opened. Not only does the “online orders only” coupons never work when attempting to use them, but the food which one pays full price for is so terrible that a person seriously would be better off going elsewhere. "
7t"Domino's completely reduced their quality of their pizza to a point it's as lost inedible. Extremely dry. The Philly cheese steak only had a few burnt flakes on it. They cut it now thinner than paper I swear. The mushroom pizza was pathetic too. I swear they only used one mushroom the size of a dime on the entire pizza and that's being generous. They lost this customer forever. Auf Wiedersehen."
8t"Online ordering is crap. Only way to get the good specials is online. Both me and my wife can't make it happen and same with our neighbors. Causes to go to Pizza Hut. Domino's needs to do something to fix this."
9t"I will not order the tots again. They were soggy and not edible at all. Maybe if they were more crispy it would have been better. But not my experience with them. Maybe after time they will get it right."
10t"When I walked in the employee said ''hello what would you like today?'' Then I just got the best pepperoni pizza of my life. So good. The pizza was not burned. it was the way I like my pizza and I think everyone else would like it too."

21t"Friday March 24th I think, I went online and ordered a pizza for 2:15 and when I went to pick it up I arrived at 2:17 and it was brought outside curbside and handed to me and 5 minutes back to the house I opened it to have a slice in my friends that there's. It was cold as ice like it had been made 6 hours before or something. It tasted like leather. We had to throw it out and go to Angelotti's. It sucked.. It appeared that they had fixed the pizza 2 hours before and left it there until I came out because it is ice cold and tasted leathery. It was the worst Pizza that Domino's has ever given me and it is the worst service I've ever had there. They ought to be ashamed of themselves and bringing something like that out to a person. I only live 5 minutes from them if that and it was a specialty pizza and it was bad and I mean severely bad I'm not even exaggerating..."
22t"I order cheese steak pizza. It was the worst ever had. It was burnt. Yes they replace that order but still was awful. Didn't taste like cheese steak which was my favorite pizza from there. Never again will I order from there. Worst experience ever. They are replacing something on the pizza so it'll cost just as much more than it's worth. I know just because I'm one person they probably don't ever care."
23t"Today I shopped at 2265 Towne Lake Pkwy #104, Woodstock, GA 30189 And my order was cold and without any quality. The 6 cheese Pizza didn't have 6 cheese, it tasted awful. We ordered a stuffed bread and it had no fillings. We paid $40 dollars for bad quality. I am very sad about the quality that was once very good, but today I do not recommend and do not buy from this place anymore. A lot of disrespect for the customer."
24t"On Thursday, March 16, 2023, at approximately 4:45pm I placed a order for pizza. At approximately 6:00 I noticed that my pizza had not arrived. I then called customer service to see if I could get some answers as to the status of my order. The customer service representative stated that they only took orders and were unable to track my order. I was then advised to call the local store to speak with someone concerning my order. I then called the local Dominos located in Lauderdale Lakes Fl, The phone rang and with a advertised recording playing. I was on hold for more than 30 minutes. I hung up the phone and decided to choose a different place for my family and I to have our meal. "
25t"A Domino's Pizza in Jacksonville, Florida messed up my order and delivered pizzas with no toppings at all. Then they took more from my account than the amount of the bill. It's been a month and they have refused to respond and refund my money."
26t"Prior to my recent online order on March 11, I had nothing bad to say about Domino's. I had ordered two times before this date. Everything that I ordered before was good. My order on March 11, however, wasn't good at all. My pizza was barely sliced and was very greasy. My tater tots tasted as if they were old. All that was on the tater tots were cheddar cheese and bacon. I'm not sure what the white sauce is, whether it's some type of cheese, but I didn't receive any white sauce as displayed in the picture on their website. The bacon was hard and burnt. The ONLY thing that was good were the three chocolate cakes that I ordered. These I love as this makes the third time I ordered them."
27t"I've ordered Domino's Pizza in NC and FL, they deliver up to 20 minutes or more away normally. They're less than 10 minutes away, but say they won't deliver. Yet advertise a day on my TV and will deliver them say..**!!!!"
28t"I understand with the economy, Domino's has to charge for Delivery. They also add more to the price of the food you're ordering. They even add more to the price depending on what crust you choose for the pizza. So to skip the $5.00 Delivery fee, the $1.99 crust fee, and the Extra $1.00 per pizza, I ordered plain, and picked it up myself. So, If I go pick up my own $40 order, WTF! Why am I being asked to leave a tip: 10%, 15%, 20% or $4, $6, $8? That's why I'm picking it up because you've lost my delivery service, do you really want to lose my pickup service also! At my job no one ever says I'm going to get my salary and depending on how well I do, maybe a 20% Tip!"
29t"I didn’t even order Domino's or go in. This is a full on personal experience, while driving with my fiancé, our 2 children in the back seat. A driver pulled out in front of us with maybe 20 feet to spare. We had to slam on our breaks so hard our daughter hit her head against the door even while buckled in. We almost slid into oncoming traffic and was almost hit head on to miss the delivery driver. HORRIBLE. IF YOURE GOING TO BE A DELIVERY BUSINESS HAVE SOMEONE WORTH A ** DRIVING!!!! Bad business just to “just talk to the driver” like the manager said he would. What if my kids would have been killed or injured??? To deliver a pizza to a dispensary. Horrible. Will never go to Domino's again."
30t"I have ordered pizza from Domino's for forty years. I will never order another one. The last pan pizza I bought looked like cheese soup. Looked like there was no crust. Almost like it was soaked in water!! It was disgusting. There's no way they didn't know it looked like ** when it was delivered. NEVER AGAIN!"
31t"Order online. Great experience one night. Next time order canceled and told outside service area. Tell the truth. Back to Marco's for me. They answer the phone and actually appear to want the business."
32t"Store #3862, located on 900 S Federal Highway Fort Lauderdale, FL 33316, is the worst store I've ever tried ordering from before. They deliver until 1 AM, so it says on their site, but despite that, even though we tried ordering delivery before even 12 AM, they accepted our order, let it say they were prepping it for about fifteen to twenty minutes, and then cancelled our order on us. We tried calling a couple times and were stuck on hold for over half an hour, tried ordering again, and it got cancelled again, even though we ordered over fifty dollars of food for our family. "
33t"After debating on even whether to order out for a pizza I decided to make the order on the internet. It said it would be done by 9:12. At 9:02 it said it was ready. I drove around the block. All the parking spots were full that I could get my F-150 into. When they were supposed to have had the pizza to my truck already I called. They come outside they go back inside then they come out and say, ""Park your truck and we'll bring your pizza out."" I said, ""Keep your pizza. I've been sitting out here for 2 minutes. You should already had it out here."" "
34t"I just made my last trip to Domino's EVER!! I did not order the Pizza, but I did last week and it is horrible! Tasteless crust, very little cheese, marinara sauce that is too sweet, and pepperoni with no flavor. Today was the worst! I live in Buffalo NY and know that you get the best Buffalo Wings from our local restaurants, NOT national chains. The ONLY reason I ordered Buffalo wings from Domino's is I had a gift card to use up. I ordered 32 Buffalo Wings along with 4 Blue Cheese cups for $36. Ladies and Gentlemen, Domino's should be permanently shut down for how bad these wings were. Forget deep fried or even an Air Fryer/Convection oven to make the wings crispy. The wings were baked. The skin was rubbery. The wings were so small that I felt sorry for the flock of Pidgeon's who gave their life for this horrendous order. "
35t"I was not happy with an order I received. I made a complaint and was promised a refund. I have still not received any refund! These people make the worst so called pizza and then don't live up to their refund promise! It's sickening!"
36t"We ordered a Hawaiian pizza, and 2 more items, cost was almost $45, we were supposed to get it by 6:32 pm today and the app tracker said the delivery was completed around 6:40 pm but we never got it, even that we put the instructions where to leave the order and all that, my daughter had to call the store to let them know, by the time the delivery driver was arriving to the store and he told my daughter in which apartment number he left our order and asked her if she wanted him to bring it to our place or if we we're fine. I told my daughter to tell him to bring it to our apartment as the original instructions we requested, anyways long story short the driver never apologize for the misplaced and we ended up with a cold pizza and other items delivered freaking late, poor service and it was a bad experience for us."
37t"Worst and most frustrating online website ordering system ever. Not my first experience with issues on this website. Definitely not very user friendly. Just wanted to redeem a free medium two topping pizza voucher I received for buying a $25 gift card. Now I'll have to go back."
38t"The promotional ad that says you will receive a three dollar tip for picking up your own pizza is total garbage. It is a three dollar coupon that expires in one week. All that means is you need to order another pizza within a week. That is not a tip! A tip should be a three dollar refund when you pick up your own pizza!"
39t"I completed and online order January 11, 2023 I inadvertently ordered a pizza from the Mountain Veiw CA store in error. I was in Cypress TX at the time. I TRIED CALL the Mountain veiw Store for hours total 10 call, no answer however some calls did go to the call center which they could not help. No one answered my calls or even return them. Call Domino's so call Customer support, spoke with a guy, explain my story, then he indicated they would get with the store and refund the monies charged. There has been no follow through, no one to contact at Domino support just a voice mail used the Bot for a return call nothing... no call or response. I've waste so much time on this which has lead me to write poor review all over the internet and tell as many friends as possible. THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE CUSTOMER. THEY JUST WANT TO TAKE YOUR MONEY!!!!"
40t"PLEASE DON'T CHEAT YOUR CUSTOMERS. Today I order at 11:26am & my order was delivered at 12:10pm, according to '30 minutes delivery guarantee' my order should be free. But when I tell them about late delivery they show 'Apologies! Your Order is not applicable for Service Guarantee.' and delivery time is showing 11:53am. They even send me SMS at 11:52 about delay in delivery. You don't want to give free pizza & stick to your policy. At least stop making fool out of your customers."
41t"Ordered a pizza for Delivery from Domino's Pizza in Midland, MI. Unbeknownst to me, my doorbell no longer works. Of course, as luck would have it, the Domino's Delivery Driver rang the door bell. I did not answer, so driver left the pizza box on my porch. After my third call to the store I was finally notified pizza box was on the porch. About 30 minutes after the driver left it, I got my pizza and of course it was cold. Why couldn't the driver have simply knocked on the door? Additionally, they put jalapeno peppers on the pizza which I did not order. Asked for refund, but was denied. I will never order from them again and neither should you."
42t"The recent pizza from Dominos was a sham and a shame! The crust was dry overdone, not really edible. My dog wouldn't eat it either! The so-called three toppings were barely visible - onions, mushrooms, pepperoni was so scant, it was simply sad! The sauce too was now hot! Someone decided everyone likes their mouths on fire apparently."
43t"This is a worst place. Very rude and inhumane customer service. Nobody should be treated this way. I can't believe this store even exist in USA. I am ** immigrant myself but I am sorry if this is the kinda culture we are adopting and heading toward, the future of USA doesn't look bright to me. Jan 1 2023, After working 12 hours, I got to this store at around 7-8 p.m, and ordered buffalo chicken pizza with pineapple toppings worth $20. They ask me to wait 10-15 min, I waited more than 20 min. That's fine. I took the pizza and drove home. "
44t"Domino’s was always a consistent, yummy treat when we could get to the city. But whatever changes they made with the crust and sauce are not good. Yuck. What a disappointment. It also doesn’t reheat very well at all. Back to Papa John's I go!"
45t"Received a burnt pizza and pasta and manager on duty Nena at the West Spring Creek location in Plano TX who I was able to record on my phone refused to send another order out stating we will just complain again and she rather refund the money. After asking several times to redo order she still refused and said to call back almost 2 hours later to speak with her General Manager Kat **…. I have never experienced such horrible food and ridiculous “customer service”."
46t"Picked up a pizza from Domino's today. It was lacking the marinara and cheese. They somehow remembered to put on pepperoni which was kind of them. I'm not sure if the workers there are angry at management or they company or customers or all of the above but it will be the last time I ever order from Domino's. I'll be sharing my experience with everyone that I ever see looking to order food. Say goodbye to your revenues."
47t"We ordered pizza yesterday from website online. We received the discount of RS.300 but when the pizza got delivered they charged us extra amount and when we called the store manager he directly refused to take responsibility of the extra payment and started speaking rudely on the call. When we contacted customer service they mentioned no extra amount should be charged. Still store manager took extra money."
48t"I have tried to contact a person in customer service. There is no way to do this. Avoid any company that knows its product is so horrible, that they do not even offer customer service. I will never, ever, order from Domino's again."
49t"This pizza is SO delicious for the price. They have REALLY upped the bar from the Domino's I had growing up!! Loaded with fresh toppings. I such great customer service too! I messed up my order on a busy night - they happily remade my pizza, quickly without hesitation."
50t"I received a coupon for a free medium 2 topping pizza. However, there is a minimum $15 purchase for delivery and the coupon required that the Pizza had to be delivered! So really unless you were already planning on spending at least $15 dollars, the coupon Is worthless. I wouldn’t have minded a delivery fee, but spending $15 for a not so free $6.99 pizza?"
51t"My family had the best delivery driver experience ever on Easter of 2023. The pizza was incredible. The service was fast. I would give it a 20 star rating if I could.

53t"OH, this restaurant is So worth it. I mean listen. They put the most effort into their food than any other restaurant I have ever been to. The crust was nothing like ever before.

I bought it from 1171 Upper James location."
55t"Assistant was very Professional and understood my complaint to the fullest with no attitude…Got right to the problem at hand and rectified the situation without it going overboard or to the next level, my problem was heard and not just given attitude, very, very Professional. 10/10 that that she resolved my problem and rectified the situation without further speaking to a higher figure!"

Ladies and Gentlemen, Domino's should be permanently shut down for how bad these wings were. Forget deep fried or even an Air Fryer/Convection oven to make the wings crispy. The wings were baked. The skin was rubbery. The wings were so small that I felt sorry for the flock of Pidgeon's who gave their life for this horrendous order. "
75t"I was not happy with an order I received. I made a complaint and was promised a refund. I have still not received any refund! These people make the worst so called pizza and then don't live up to their refund promise! It's sickening!"
76t"We ordered a Hawaiian pizza, and 2 more items, cost was almost $45, we were supposed to get it by 6:32 pm today and the app tracker said the delivery was completed around 6:40 pm but we never got it, even that we put the instructions where to leave the order and all that, my daughter had to call the store to let them know, by the time the delivery driver was arriving to the store and he told my daughter in which apartment number he left our order and asked her if she wanted him to bring it to our place or if we we're fine. I told my daughter to tell him to bring it to our apartment as the original instructions we requested, anyways long story short the driver never apologize for the misplaced and we ended up with a cold pizza and other items delivered freaking late, poor service and it was a bad experience for us."
77t"Worst and most frustrating online website ordering system ever. Not my first experience with issues on this website. Definitely not very user friendly. Just wanted to redeem a free medium two topping pizza voucher I received for buying a $25 gift card. Now I'll have to go back."
78t"The promotional ad that says you will receive a three dollar tip for picking up your own pizza is total garbage. It is a three dollar coupon that expires in one week. All that means is you need to order another pizza within a week. That is not a tip! A tip should be a three dollar refund when you pick up your own pizza!"
79t"I completed and online order January 11, 2023 I inadvertently ordered a pizza from the Mountain Veiw CA store in error. I was in Cypress TX at the time. I TRIED CALL the Mountain veiw Store for hours total 10 call, no answer however some calls did go to the call center which they could not help. No one answered my calls or even return them. Call Domino's so call Customer support, spoke with a guy, explain my story, then he indicated they would get with the store and refund the monies charged. There has been no follow through, no one to contact at Domino support just a voice mail used the Bot for a return call nothing... no call or response. I've waste so much time on this which has lead me to write poor review all over the internet and tell as many friends as possible. THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE CUSTOMER. THEY JUST WANT TO TAKE YOUR MONEY!!!!"
80t"PLEASE DON'T CHEAT YOUR CUSTOMERS. Today I order at 11:26am & my order was delivered at 12:10pm, according to '30 minutes delivery guarantee' my order should be free. But when I tell them about late delivery they show 'Apologies! Your Order is not applicable for Service Guarantee.' and delivery time is showing 11:53am. They even send me SMS at 11:52 about delay in delivery. You don't want to give free pizza & stick to your policy. At least stop making fool out of your customers."
81t"Ordered a pizza for Delivery from Domino's Pizza in Midland, MI. Unbeknownst to me, my doorbell no longer works. Of course, as luck would have it, the Domino's Delivery Driver rang the door bell. I did not answer, so driver left the pizza box on my porch. After my third call to the store I was finally notified pizza box was on the porch. About 30 minutes after the driver left it, I got my pizza and of course it was cold. Why couldn't the driver have simply knocked on the door? Additionally, they put jalapeno peppers on the pizza which I did not order. Asked for refund, but was denied. I will never order from them again and neither should you."
82t"The recent pizza from Dominos was a sham and a shame! The crust was dry overdone, not really edible. My dog wouldn't eat it either! The so-called three toppings were barely visible - onions, mushrooms, pepperoni was so scant, it was simply sad! The sauce too was now hot! Someone decided everyone likes their mouths on fire apparently."
83t"This is a worst place. Very rude and inhumane customer service. Nobody should be treated this way. I can't believe this store even exist in USA. I am ** immigrant myself but I am sorry if this is the kinda culture we are adopting and heading toward, the future of USA doesn't look bright to me. Jan 1 2023, After working 12 hours, I got to this store at around 7-8 p.m, and ordered buffalo chicken pizza with pineapple toppings worth $20. They ask me to wait 10-15 min, I waited more than 20 min. That's fine. I took the pizza and drove home. "
84t"Domino’s was always a consistent, yummy treat when we could get to the city. But whatever changes they made with the crust and sauce are not good. Yuck. What a disappointment. It also doesn’t reheat very well at all. Back to Papa John's I go!"
85t"Received a burnt pizza and pasta and manager on duty Nena at the West Spring Creek location in Plano TX who I was able to record on my phone refused to send another order out stating we will just complain again and she rather refund the money. After asking several times to redo order she still refused and said to call back almost 2 hours later to speak with her General Manager Kat **…. I have never experienced such horrible food and ridiculous “customer service”."
86t"Picked up a pizza from Domino's today. It was lacking the marinara and cheese. They somehow remembered to put on pepperoni which was kind of them. I'm not sure if the workers there are angry at management or they company or customers or all of the above but it will be the last time I ever order from Domino's. I'll be sharing my experience with everyone that I ever see looking to order food. Say goodbye to your revenues."
87t"We ordered pizza yesterday from website online. We received the discount of RS.300 but when the pizza got delivered they charged us extra amount and when we called the store manager he directly refused to take responsibility of the extra payment and started speaking rudely on the call. When we contacted customer service they mentioned no extra amount should be charged. Still store manager took extra money."
88t"I have tried to contact a person in customer service. There is no way to do this. Avoid any company that knows its product is so horrible, that they do not even offer customer service. I will never, ever, order from Domino's again."
89t"This pizza is SO delicious for the price. They have REALLY upped the bar from the Domino's I had growing up!! Loaded with fresh toppings. I such great customer service too! I messed up my order on a busy night - they happily remade my pizza, quickly without hesitation."
90t"I received a coupon for a free medium 2 topping pizza. However, there is a minimum $15 purchase for delivery and the coupon required that the Pizza had to be delivered! So really unless you were already planning on spending at least $15 dollars, the coupon Is worthless. I wouldn’t have minded a delivery fee, but spending $15 for a not so free $6.99 pizza?"
91t"Placed order at 6:27 pm, delivered at 7:02 pm, missing parts of order. Driver said he would retrieve missing items from store. Called 1303 King St E, Oshawa store at 7:22 to confirm if driver had retrieved missing items. Manager said she would print new bill and send out missing items. It is now 8:11 pm and have received nothing more. Will be deleting the app and no longer be ordering from Domino's any more for this extremely disappointing experience."
92t"Stay away from here. Horrible customer service. Horrible food. I only ordered a pizza and garlic knots, for it to take 2 hours just to come cold, with no sauce, garlic knots were so damn greasy. It was just gross. Called to speak with manager, one of the associates picked up and said they had too many orders and it was nothing she could do with so much sass. I told her, ""I called to speak to a manager. Obviously there’s nothing you can do."" No apologies or nothing. She had me on hold then hung up. Called again, got a manager and I told him I just wanted a refund and that my pizza didn’t even come with sauce! No apology no nothing!"
93t"Tried using their ""any specialty pizza for $16.99"" tonight. Wouldn't honor it, kept ringing in at $18.99. Watch your bills with this company, not very reputable doing deceptive marketing. This coupon was on the Domino's site."
94t"Today 23rd Nov 22 we visited Domino’s Pizza at Andheri East near Hubtown Solaris outlet. Ordered two medium size thin crust veg pizza, to our surprise the pizza base was completely burned black. After informing the manager he asked us casually whether we need other one but did not bother to check the pizza or gave us any pizza. We waited for 15 mins for him to come But there was utterly no response and very vague attitude language by Domino's person. This led to a very negative situation to visit the brand again. I wasted my time, money and taste with my experience at Domino's."
95t"All employees are disrespect their customers, I guess it's management problems or there are no management at all, also I guess it's discrimination against some customers especially for elderly people, it's my fault that I buy Domino's, I will switch to Pizza Hut."
96t"Please don’t order any pepperoni cheese pizza from this location. This weekend the pepperoni pizza is not good. My husband and son was poison last night. They vomiting and strong stomach pain after they eat pepperoni pizza from Domino last night. They still not recovered. I order a free coupon pizza and it looks like Domino use old expired pepperoni for free promotion coupon."
97t"This is the worst company I've ever dealt with. They delivered my order 3 hours late, missing 2/3 items and the delivery driver laughed at me. They basically stole from me. Can't contact anyone at the location or office. This is the worst, most garbage business I've ever encountered. Still no response from the company or ability to speak with a human. Trash."
98t"We ordered Domino's for the 1st time in a while. My daughter loves the garlic bites. We order those and 2 garlic sauces. Which we paid extra for. When it was delivered after they left we realize we got no sauces not even the marinara that comes with it. We called to let them know. They said they would run it over and never showed. So disappointing."
99t"Great experience, the food was delicious and the girl was really patient and polite. Will come back for sure & will also refer to my friends & other who come across in my daily life. I hope you guys get these kind of employees."
100t"Ordered by phone, the call center are Foreigners and hard to understand and can't understand a SIMPLE DAMN PIZZA ORDER. When I went to pick it up it was COLD, all kind of BLACK STUFF in pizza box. These kids don't know how to sweep out the oven. The Cinnamon Twist didn't have icing in the box. This happens all the time. The menu states 1 icing. They always leave it OUT. This is DUE TO TWO THING 1. Either the EMPLOYEES are IDIOTS. 2. THE MANAGERS ARE IDIOTS BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO TRAIN THE EMPLOYEES. From all the problems coming out of the MACON GA, FORSYTH RD STORE THE COMPANY NEEDS TO GET NEW MANAGERS."
101t"We have enjoyed pizza here in the past, however, when I got there to pick it up I did notice that it was busier than usual, not sure if that impacted the pizza we ordered...when we got home our pizza was burnt, and just tasted terrible. We are not sure what the problem was but we will take our business elsewhere."
102t"We just ordered Pizza, wings, salads, and sodas from the store at: 2700 Carlisle Road York, PA 17408. I have ordered from this store in the past and not experienced any issues with our orders. However, tonight was a different kind of experience. I placed the order and had it delivered out of convenience with having a house full of family. Our order came to $100 and when it was delivered they brought 3 20oz sodas opposed to the 3 2litters we ordered. Called back and spoke to the manager, Jenny [from the block] who exhibited zero good customer service skills. Jenny made no effort to resolve the error, outside of asking if we would like to purchase additional sodas. This will be our last order from this store and possibly Dominos altogether. This is definitely not the same Dominos with customer service oriented policies and protocols. We highly recommend that you do not use this business!!!"
103t"Domino's - a well know Pizza brand have served me very badly last month. I ordered 1 pizza & 1 coco lava (my 1 of the most fav. from their menu), but I only received Pizza, coco lava - was MISSING. I raised complaint many times, tried reaching customer care too every time they promised resolution with 24 hrs. but 'til I haven't received a single call from them not my refund. I ordered from Domino's app which is my biggest, if I would have done from Swiggy or Zomato - I must have received instant refund. I LOST TRUST IN YOU DOMINO's."
104t"We normally get our hoagies from Foxe's or Vocelli pizza but we wanted to try the new Dominos...Should of listened to the horrible reviews from friends and other people! We ordered a Philly steak ""sandwich""..When I was handed this tiny box I knew I was going to be disappointed..It was just burned cheese and a FEW burned peppers.. Absolutely no mushrooms or maybe there were. Couldn't tell since it was completely burnt. ABSOLUTELY NO TYPE OF MEAT! I can guarantee this business will be belly up w/in a year. The reviews and comments from people are just disappointed and rip off of their money and time. I can't even go to their website to make a complaint. Didn't even bother calling the business...since others have said they were just refused when attempting to either get a refund or something else in the place of what they messed up for the order..DO NOT GO TO NORTH APOLLO DOMINO'S PIZZA!!"
105t"I have never had an issue until today... Domino's Pizza has incremented prices but decreased quality, today I ordered a ham and pineapple pizza and besides being cold, it had so much sauce that it was impossible to eat due being soggy and cloying, also the box was full of grease. After being a loyal customer for a few years, today was the last time that I ordered, I sent my complain to them via online and they offered me a free pizza or 20% discount but to be honest all I wanted is to be reimbursed."
106t"I ordered dinner delivered from Domino's, Gymea, for my family at a cost of $70. Three hours later dinner still hadn't arrived. I tried to call repeatedly but staff were ignoring the phone. So I went into Domino's to complain. I was offered a refund which I was told would take two days to return to my bank account. Well It's been one month and despite repeated phone calls and promises the refund will be in my account 'tomorrow' I am still waiting. Never again Domino's. I am about to call Consumer Affairs and complain about you. I hope you go broke."
107t"I ordered a Philly Beef Sandwich from Domino's Pizza in North Brach MN ON 10/24/2022. STAFF WAS FRIENDLY. My question is WHERE'S THE BEEF? Very sparse amount of Beef in this sandwich, in fact there was more cheese than anything. Terrible quality."
108t"The managers routinely stole my online delivery tips and were very bold about doing so. When 1 of the managers was informed she also began to also steal my tips. Theives at Michigan Store 1085 on Plymouth Road."
109t"25 SEP 22 I picked up a carry-out order from Dominos store #3551, located at 132 Tuckahoe Rd in Yonkers, NY. Upon entering the establishment, I witnessed the 2 staff members in the back of the store preparing food with their bare-hands. The members were touching the uncooked meats, cheeses & vegetables whilst adjusting their clothes and hair. The practice was incredibly unsanitary, cross-contaminating the food and no one seems to care. I reached out to Domino's that same night via email, it has been 25 days and I have heard nothing since from the company. This matter needs to be addressed immediately for the safety of the consumers."
110t"The thing that tops my experience is the SUPERB customer service. Arrick is beyond amazing and is the reason we will be back! He made sure my order was correct and I had everything I need. He is respectful and professional. The app ordering was simple and easy and the food is consistently tasty."
111t"If you drive by a Domino's Pizza and get a sudden craving, go to any other pizza store, because you will be penalized for ordering in-store. They want you to order online. You need to plan your visit."
112t"I ordered two pizzas for takeaway and garlic breadsticks..After I reached home I saw my second pizza was wrong one and after eating first one it felt like it was made long before I gave my order. Hardly any taste."
113t"9/10/22 I order chicken wings and salad and waiting for my order to be delivered and never showed. Call them to see and they snapped and said I would have to come and pick up. I said no and to deliver my damn order and they claimed they already did and that was a lie. 975 Grand Ave Saint Paul Mn 55105 needs to be shut down immediately. Poor service, poor management, poor staff, sad. So stay away from this location if you can. They don’t deserve customers or anything but a shutdown."
114t"I have order from Domino’s in Kimberly WI numerous times and always have had issues. After waiting for 1 hour and 37 min for our dinner and being dissatisfied with the service and the quality of the product Today I am taking the time to write my first review ever because I am tired of this. Our pizza came without cheese and the pasta looked like it was eaten out of. I will never order from this location again. If I could give less stars I would and if I could attach a picture I would."
115t"Me and my wife was told they didn’t have change for a 100$ then was told that they don’t take bills bigger than a 50$ then I was asked to hand back the food that was already in my car and was told to go get some small bills and and come back. Will never go back."
116t"I spent 20 minutes navigating their app to order dinner, consider the pop-up offers to add things, etc. Two minutes later the store manager calls me to say their store can only do pick-up orders for the rest of the night due to a driver shortage. Regardless whether I cancel altogether or switch to pick-up, she'll have to cancel my payment, which won't be refunded for 72 hrs. I ordered pizza in the 1st place because my week is so busy that there's little chance I'll remember to check for my refund in 72 hrs. Also, I have now spent the money I planned to spend tonight, on delivery, but I still have to order dinner. If my Kroger app can tell me my favorite salsa is available at the store near my kid's school, but not the one near our house, I don't accept that Domino's is incapable of warning me that I can't order delivery from my neighborhood store tonight... BEFORE they take my money."
117t"Once in a blue moon I think of having pizza, so today I ordered it from Domino's to have it in my lunch. At 3:41pm I ordered it and waited for 2 long hours and no delivery was made. There wasn't any response from the restaurant and the app just showed that my order will be delivered shortly. This is how the service of Domino's Pizza has degraded soo much. I will never order again, please stay away from mental harassment people."
118t"Okay so about a month and a half ago I ordered food for $41 and some cents and I never received it. So I did get it refunded but at the end of the day the manager call me back 3 days ago and offered me two free pizzas and said that they will be available to me at any time but the day before I tried yesterday and there's always an issue so now I have to pay a delivery fee. So I didn't have the money for which I don't think I need delivery fee because the food was supposed to be delivered and I never got it so that should be included. "
119t"I'm very disgusted and disappointed with my pizza. I don't usually go to Domino's but rather Pizza Hut. We saw there was 50% off pizzas and wanted to get some.  But that was horrible idea. I didn't have Domino's that long ago and it was absolutely amazing! But this.. This was a nightmare! We didn't have anymore money afterwards to get more food so that was the only thing we had in our fridge. It gave me food poisoning and made me vomit. You also got my order wrong. I asked for bacon not sausage on my pizza and medium sauce not high. And let me tell you one final thing the garbage from the dumpster from Kwik Trip tastes a lot better than your food. (Sorry for all capitals)."
120t"They never sent our food then they wanted to send us food food. Worst customer service ever. I ordered. They sent it to wrong address then the way they wanted to help was to send us cold food. Not a good fix. Nobody wants cold lunch then they said they called but didn’t call my phone."
121t"My family had the best delivery driver experience ever on Easter of 2023. The pizza was incredible. The service was fast. I would give it a 20 star rating if I could. The driver was extremely polite. I have never had service like that in my life. I wish I got his name. Excellent service. Thanks Domino's."
122t"The Domino's in Tuscumbia, AL is by far the best anywhere around here! They have the best customer service and when I called about my missing pizza, the manager I spoke with, Leslie, was super nice and had no issues with correcting the mistake. I am a loyal customer for life thanks to her!"
123t"OH, this restaurant is So worth it. I mean listen. They put the most effort into their food than any other restaurant I have ever been to. The crust was nothing like ever before. You know Pizza Hut, they have crunchy regular crusts the boring part of the pizza oh but Domino's? It was crunchy on the outside and soft and delicious on the inside. The pepperoni was crunchy and flavorful. And Oh My Gosh the cinnamon twists dipped in the served icing was the best dessert,  completing perfect satisfaction to meet my requirements. And overall this fantastic restaurant is a must-go and I will forever eat there."
124t"I ordered stuffed cheesy bread for a change and it was absolutely worth of every penny! It was so cheesy and satisfying. The cheese was so stringy when you were taking pieces apart and was so satisfying. I absolutely recommend it to others. Their advertisement matches to the quality of their product. I bought it from 1171 Upper James location."
125t"Assistant was very Professional and understood my complaint to the fullest with no attitude…Got right to the problem at hand and rectified the situation without it going overboard or to the next level, my problem was heard and not just given attitude, very, very Professional. 10/10 that that she resolved my problem and rectified the situation without further speaking to a higher figure!"
126t"For the second time in the history of New Castle, IN’s luxury offerings, the city has opened another Domino’s Pizza restaurant (not since 199x has the city had a Domino’s). And though this new Domino’s started out actually putting an effort into making quality food, it has quickly gone downhill in the few months it has been opened. Not only does the “online orders only” coupons never work when attempting to use them, but the food which one pays full price for is so terrible that a person seriously would be better off going elsewhere. "
127t"Domino's completely reduced their quality of their pizza to a point it's as lost inedible. Extremely dry. The Philly cheese steak only had a few burnt flakes on it. They cut it now thinner than paper I swear. The mushroom pizza was pathetic too. I swear they only used one mushroom the size of a dime on the entire pizza and that's being generous. They lost this customer forever. Auf Wiedersehen."
128t"Online ordering is crap. Only way to get the good specials is online. Both me and my wife can't make it happen and same with our neighbors. Causes to go to Pizza Hut. Domino's needs to do something to fix this."
129t"I will not order the tots again. They were soggy and not edible at all. Maybe if they were more crispy it would have been better. But not my experience with them. Maybe after time they will get it right."
130t"When I walked in the employee said ''hello what would you like today?'' Then I just got the best pepperoni pizza of my life. So good. The pizza was not burned. it was the way I like my pizza and I think everyone else would like it too."
131t"Friday March 24th I think, I went online and ordered a pizza for 2:15 and when I went to pick it up I arrived at 2:17 and it was brought outside curbside and handed to me and 5 minutes back to the house I opened it to have a slice in my friends that there's. It was cold as ice like it had been made 6 hours before or something. It tasted like leather. We had to throw it out and go to Angelotti's. It sucked.. It appeared that they had fixed the pizza 2 hours before and left it there until I came out because it is ice cold and tasted leathery. It was the worst Pizza that Domino's has ever given me and it is the worst service I've ever had there. They ought to be ashamed of themselves and bringing something like that out to a person. I only live 5 minutes from them if that and it was a specialty pizza and it was bad and I mean severely bad I'm not even exaggerating..."
132t"I order cheese steak pizza. It was the worst ever had. It was burnt. Yes they replace that order but still was awful. Didn't taste like cheese steak which was my favorite pizza from there. Never again will I order from there. Worst experience ever. They are replacing something on the pizza so it'll cost just as much more than it's worth. I know just because I'm one person they probably don't ever care."
133t"Today I shopped at 2265 Towne Lake Pkwy #104, Woodstock, GA 30189 And my order was cold and without any quality. The 6 cheese Pizza didn't have 6 cheese, it tasted awful. We ordered a stuffed bread and it had no fillings. We paid $40 dollars for bad quality. I am very sad about the quality that was once very good, but today I do not recommend and do not buy from this place anymore. A lot of disrespect for the customer."
134t"On Thursday, March 16, 2023, at approximately 4:45pm I placed a order for pizza. At approximately 6:00 I noticed that my pizza had not arrived. I then called customer service to see if I could get some answers as to the status of my order. The customer service representative stated that they only took orders and were unable to track my order. I was then advised to call the local store to speak with someone concerning my order. I then called the local Dominos located in Lauderdale Lakes Fl, The phone rang and with a advertised recording playing. I was on hold for more than 30 minutes. I hung up the phone and decided to choose a different place for my family and I to have our meal. "
135t"A Domino's Pizza in Jacksonville, Florida messed up my order and delivered pizzas with no toppings at all. Then they took more from my account than the amount of the bill. It's been a month and they have refused to respond and refund my money."
136t"Prior to my recent online order on March 11, I had nothing bad to say about Domino's. I had ordered two times before this date. Everything that I ordered before was good. My order on March 11, however, wasn't good at all. My pizza was barely sliced and was very greasy. My tater tots tasted as if they were old. All that was on the tater tots were cheddar cheese and bacon. I'm not sure what the white sauce is, whether it's some type of cheese, but I didn't receive any white sauce as displayed in the picture on their website. The bacon was hard and burnt. The ONLY thing that was good were the three chocolate cakes that I ordered. These I love as this makes the third time I ordered them."
137t"I've ordered Domino's Pizza in NC and FL, they deliver up to 20 minutes or more away normally. They're less than 10 minutes away, but say they won't deliver. Yet advertise a day on my TV and will deliver them say..**!!!!"
138t"I understand with the economy, Domino's has to charge for Delivery. They also add more to the price of the food you're ordering. They even add more to the price depending on what crust you choose for the pizza. So to skip the $5.00 Delivery fee, the $1.99 crust fee, and the Extra $1.00 per pizza, I ordered plain, and picked it up myself. So, If I go pick up my own $40 order, WTF! Why am I being asked to leave a tip: 10%, 15%, 20% or $4, $6, $8? That's why I'm picking it up because you've lost my delivery service, do you really want to lose my pickup service also! At my job no one ever says I'm going to get my salary and depending on how well I do, maybe a 20% Tip!"
139t"I didn’t even order Domino's or go in. This is a full on personal experience, while driving with my fiancé, our 2 children in the back seat. A driver pulled out in front of us with maybe 20 feet to spare. We had to slam on our breaks so hard our daughter hit her head against the door even while buckled in. We almost slid into oncoming traffic and was almost hit head on to miss the delivery driver. HORRIBLE. IF YOURE GOING TO BE A DELIVERY BUSINESS HAVE SOMEONE WORTH A ** DRIVING!!!! Bad business just to “just talk to the driver” like the manager said he would. What if my kids would have been killed or injured??? To deliver a pizza to a dispensary. Horrible. Will never go to Domino's again."
140t"I have ordered pizza from Domino's for forty years. I will never order another one. The last pan pizza I bought looked like cheese soup. Looked like there was no crust. Almost like it was soaked in water!! It was disgusting. There's no way they didn't know it looked like ** when it was delivered. NEVER AGAIN!"
141t"Order online. Great experience one night. Next time order canceled and told outside service area. Tell the truth. Back to Marco's for me. They answer the phone and actually appear to want the business."
142t"Store #3862, located on 900 S Federal Highway Fort Lauderdale, FL 33316, is the worst store I've ever tried ordering from before. They deliver until 1 AM, so it says on their site, but despite that, even though we tried ordering delivery before even 12 AM, they accepted our order, let it say they were prepping it for about fifteen to twenty minutes, and then cancelled our order on us. We tried calling a couple times and were stuck on hold for over half an hour, tried ordering again, and it got cancelled again, even though we ordered over fifty dollars of food for our family. "
143t"After debating on even whether to order out for a pizza I decided to make the order on the internet. It said it would be done by 9:12. At 9:02 it said it was ready. I drove around the block. All the parking spots were full that I could get my F-150 into. When they were supposed to have had the pizza to my truck already I called. They come outside they go back inside then they come out and say, ""Park your truck and we'll bring your pizza out."" I said, ""Keep your pizza. I've been sitting out here for 2 minutes. You should already had it out here."" "
144t"I just made my last trip to Domino's EVER!! I did not order the Pizza, but I did last week and it is horrible! Tasteless crust, very little cheese, marinara sauce that is too sweet, and pepperoni with no flavor. Today was the worst! I live in Buffalo NY and know that you get the best Buffalo Wings from our local restaurants, NOT national chains. The ONLY reason I ordered Buffalo wings from Domino's is I had a gift card to use up. I ordered 32 Buffalo Wings along with 4 Blue Cheese cups for $36. Ladies and Gentlemen, Domino's should be permanently shut down for how bad these wings were. Forget deep fried or even an Air Fryer/Convection oven to make the wings crispy. The wings were baked. The skin was rubbery. The wings were so small that I felt sorry for the flock of Pidgeon's who gave their life for this horrendous order. "
145t"I was not happy with an order I received. I made a complaint and was promised a refund. I have still not received any refund! These people make the worst so called pizza and then don't live up to their refund promise! It's sickening!"
146t"We ordered a Hawaiian pizza, and 2 more items, cost was almost $45, we were supposed to get it by 6:32 pm today and the app tracker said the delivery was completed around 6:40 pm but we never got it, even that we put the instructions where to leave the order and all that, my daughter had to call the store to let them know, by the time the delivery driver was arriving to the store and he told my daughter in which apartment number he left our order and asked her if she wanted him to bring it to our place or if we we're fine. I told my daughter to tell him to bring it to our apartment as the original instructions we requested, anyways long story short the driver never apologize for the misplaced and we ended up with a cold pizza and other items delivered freaking late, poor service and it was a bad experience for us."
147t"Worst and most frustrating online website ordering system ever. Not my first experience with issues on this website. Definitely not very user friendly. Just wanted to redeem a free medium two topping pizza voucher I received for buying a $25 gift card. Now I'll have to go back."
148t"The promotional ad that says you will receive a three dollar tip for picking up your own pizza is total garbage. It is a three dollar coupon that expires in one week. All that means is you need to order another pizza within a week. That is not a tip! A tip should be a three dollar refund when you pick up your own pizza!"
149t"I completed and online order January 11, 2023 I inadvertently ordered a pizza from the Mountain Veiw CA store in error. I was in Cypress TX at the time. I TRIED CALL the Mountain veiw Store for hours total 10 call, no answer however some calls did go to the call center which they could not help. No one answered my calls or even return them. Call Domino's so call Customer support, spoke with a guy, explain my story, then he indicated they would get with the store and refund the monies charged. There has been no follow through, no one to contact at Domino support just a voice mail used the Bot for a return call nothing... no call or response. I've waste so much time on this which has lead me to write poor review all over the internet and tell as many friends as possible. THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE CUSTOMER. THEY JUST WANT TO TAKE YOUR MONEY!!!!"
150t"PLEASE DON'T CHEAT YOUR CUSTOMERS. Today I order at 11:26am & my order was delivered at 12:10pm, according to '30 minutes delivery guarantee' my order should be free. But when I tell them about late delivery they show 'Apologies! Your Order is not applicable for Service Guarantee.' and delivery time is showing 11:53am. They even send me SMS at 11:52 about delay in delivery. You don't want to give free pizza & stick to your policy. At least stop making fool out of your customers."
151t"Ordered a pizza for Delivery from Domino's Pizza in Midland, MI. Unbeknownst to me, my doorbell no longer works. Of course, as luck would have it, the Domino's Delivery Driver rang the door bell. I did not answer, so driver left the pizza box on my porch. After my third call to the store I was finally notified pizza box was on the porch. About 30 minutes after the driver left it, I got my pizza and of course it was cold. Why couldn't the driver have simply knocked on the door? Additionally, they put jalapeno peppers on the pizza which I did not order. Asked for refund, but was denied. I will never order from them again and neither should you."
152t"The recent pizza from Dominos was a sham and a shame! The crust was dry overdone, not really edible. My dog wouldn't eat it either! The so-called three toppings were barely visible - onions, mushrooms, pepperoni was so scant, it was simply sad! The sauce too was now hot! Someone decided everyone likes their mouths on fire apparently."
153t"This is a worst place. Very rude and inhumane customer service. Nobody should be treated this way. I can't believe this store even exist in USA. I am ** immigrant myself but I am sorry if this is the kinda culture we are adopting and heading toward, the future of USA doesn't look bright to me. Jan 1 2023, After working 12 hours, I got to this store at around 7-8 p.m, and ordered buffalo chicken pizza with pineapple toppings worth $20. They ask me to wait 10-15 min, I waited more than 20 min. That's fine. I took the pizza and drove home. "
154t"Domino’s was always a consistent, yummy treat when we could get to the city. But whatever changes they made with the crust and sauce are not good. Yuck. What a disappointment. It also doesn’t reheat very well at all. Back to Papa John's I go!"
155t"Received a burnt pizza and pasta and manager on duty Nena at the West Spring Creek location in Plano TX who I was able to record on my phone refused to send another order out stating we will just complain again and she rather refund the money. After asking several times to redo order she still refused and said to call back almost 2 hours later to speak with her General Manager Kat **…. I have never experienced such horrible food and ridiculous “customer service”."
156t"Picked up a pizza from Domino's today. It was lacking the marinara and cheese. They somehow remembered to put on pepperoni which was kind of them. I'm not sure if the workers there are angry at management or they company or customers or all of the above but it will be the last time I ever order from Domino's. I'll be sharing my experience with everyone that I ever see looking to order food. Say goodbye to your revenues."
157t"We ordered pizza yesterday from website online. We received the discount of RS.300 but when the pizza got delivered they charged us extra amount and when we called the store manager he directly refused to take responsibility of the extra payment and started speaking rudely on the call. When we contacted customer service they mentioned no extra amount should be charged. Still store manager took extra money."
158t"I have tried to contact a person in customer service. There is no way to do this. Avoid any company that knows its product is so horrible, that they do not even offer customer service. I will never, ever, order from Domino's again."
159t"This pizza is SO delicious for the price. They have REALLY upped the bar from the Domino's I had growing up!! Loaded with fresh toppings. I such great customer service too! I messed up my order on a busy night - they happily remade my pizza, quickly without hesitation."
160t"I received a coupon for a free medium 2 topping pizza. However, there is a minimum $15 purchase for delivery and the coupon required that the Pizza had to be delivered! So really unless you were already planning on spending at least $15 dollars, the coupon Is worthless. I wouldn’t have minded a delivery fee, but spending $15 for a not so free $6.99 pizza?"
161t"Placed order at 6:27 pm, delivered at 7:02 pm, missing parts of order. Driver said he would retrieve missing items from store. Called 1303 King St E, Oshawa store at 7:22 to confirm if driver had retrieved missing items. Manager said she would print new bill and send out missing items. It is now 8:11 pm and have received nothing more. Will be deleting the app and no longer be ordering from Domino's any more for this extremely disappointing experience."
162t"Stay away from here. Horrible customer service. Horrible food. I only ordered a pizza and garlic knots, for it to take 2 hours just to come cold, with no sauce, garlic knots were so damn greasy. It was just gross. Called to speak with manager, one of the associates picked up and said they had too many orders and it was nothing she could do with so much sass. I told her, ""I called to speak to a manager. Obviously there’s nothing you can do."" No apologies or nothing. She had me on hold then hung up. Called again, got a manager and I told him I just wanted a refund and that my pizza didn’t even come with sauce! No apology no nothing!"
163t"Tried using their ""any specialty pizza for $16.99"" tonight. Wouldn't honor it, kept ringing in at $18.99. Watch your bills with this company, not very reputable doing deceptive marketing. This coupon was on the Domino's site."
164t"Today 23rd Nov 22 we visited Domino’s Pizza at Andheri East near Hubtown Solaris outlet. Ordered two medium size thin crust veg pizza, to our surprise the pizza base was completely burned black. After informing the manager he asked us casually whether we need other one but did not bother to check the pizza or gave us any pizza. We waited for 15 mins for him to come But there was utterly no response and very vague attitude language by Domino's person. This led to a very negative situation to visit the brand again. I wasted my time, money and taste with my experience at Domino's."
165t"All employees are disrespect their customers, I guess it's management problems or there are no management at all, also I guess it's discrimination against some customers especially for elderly people, it's my fault that I buy Domino's, I will switch to Pizza Hut."
166t"Please don’t order any pepperoni cheese pizza from this location. This weekend the pepperoni pizza is not good. My husband and son was poison last night. They vomiting and strong stomach pain after they eat pepperoni pizza from Domino last night. They still not recovered. I order a free coupon pizza and it looks like Domino use old expired pepperoni for free promotion coupon."
167t"This is the worst company I've ever dealt with. They delivered my order 3 hours late, missing 2/3 items and the delivery driver laughed at me. They basically stole from me. Can't contact anyone at the location or office. This is the worst, most garbage business I've ever encountered. Still no response from the company or ability to speak with a human. Trash."
168t"We ordered Domino's for the 1st time in a while. My daughter loves the garlic bites. We order those and 2 garlic sauces. Which we paid extra for. When it was delivered after they left we realize we got no sauces not even the marinara that comes with it. We called to let them know. They said they would run it over and never showed. So disappointing."
169t"Great experience, the food was delicious and the girl was really patient and polite. Will come back for sure & will also refer to my friends & other who come across in my daily life. I hope you guys get these kind of employees."
170t"Ordered by phone, the call center are Foreigners and hard to understand and can't understand a SIMPLE DAMN PIZZA ORDER. When I went to pick it up it was COLD, all kind of BLACK STUFF in pizza box. These kids don't know how to sweep out the oven. The Cinnamon Twist didn't have icing in the box. This happens all the time. The menu states 1 icing. They always leave it OUT. This is DUE TO TWO THING 1. Either the EMPLOYEES are IDIOTS. 2. THE MANAGERS ARE IDIOTS BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO TRAIN THE EMPLOYEES. From all the problems coming out of the MACON GA, FORSYTH RD STORE THE COMPANY NEEDS TO GET NEW MANAGERS."
171t"We have enjoyed pizza here in the past, however, when I got there to pick it up I did notice that it was busier than usual, not sure if that impacted the pizza we ordered...when we got home our pizza was burnt, and just tasted terrible. We are not sure what the problem was but we will take our business elsewhere."
172t"We just ordered Pizza, wings, salads, and sodas from the store at: 2700 Carlisle Road York, PA 17408. I have ordered from this store in the past and not experienced any issues with our orders. However, tonight was a different kind of experience. I placed the order and had it delivered out of convenience with having a house full of family. Our order came to $100 and when it was delivered they brought 3 20oz sodas opposed to the 3 2litters we ordered. Called back and spoke to the manager, Jenny [from the block] who exhibited zero good customer service skills. Jenny made no effort to resolve the error, outside of asking if we would like to purchase additional sodas. This will be our last order from this store and possibly Dominos altogether. This is definitely not the same Dominos with customer service oriented policies and protocols. We highly recommend that you do not use this business!!!"
173t"Domino's - a well know Pizza brand have served me very badly last month. I ordered 1 pizza & 1 coco lava (my 1 of the most fav. from their menu), but I only received Pizza, coco lava - was MISSING. I raised complaint many times, tried reaching customer care too every time they promised resolution with 24 hrs. but 'til I haven't received a single call from them not my refund. I ordered from Domino's app which is my biggest, if I would have done from Swiggy or Zomato - I must have received instant refund. I LOST TRUST IN YOU DOMINO's."
174t"We normally get our hoagies from Foxe's or Vocelli pizza but we wanted to try the new Dominos...Should of listened to the horrible reviews from friends and other people! We ordered a Philly steak ""sandwich""..When I was handed this tiny box I knew I was going to be disappointed..It was just burned cheese and a FEW burned peppers.. Absolutely no mushrooms or maybe there were. Couldn't tell since it was completely burnt. ABSOLUTELY NO TYPE OF MEAT! I can guarantee this business will be belly up w/in a year. The reviews and comments from people are just disappointed and rip off of their money and time. I can't even go to their website to make a complaint. Didn't even bother calling the business...since others have said they were just refused when attempting to either get a refund or something else in the place of what they messed up for the order..DO NOT GO TO NORTH APOLLO DOMINO'S PIZZA!!"
175t"I have never had an issue until today... Domino's Pizza has incremented prices but decreased quality, today I ordered a ham and pineapple pizza and besides being cold, it had so much sauce that it was impossible to eat due being soggy and cloying, also the box was full of grease. After being a loyal customer for a few years, today was the last time that I ordered, I sent my complain to them via online and they offered me a free pizza or 20% discount but to be honest all I wanted is to be reimbursed."
176t"I ordered dinner delivered from Domino's, Gymea, for my family at a cost of $70. Three hours later dinner still hadn't arrived. I tried to call repeatedly but staff were ignoring the phone. So I went into Domino's to complain. I was offered a refund which I was told would take two days to return to my bank account. Well It's been one month and despite repeated phone calls and promises the refund will be in my account 'tomorrow' I am still waiting. Never again Domino's. I am about to call Consumer Affairs and complain about you. I hope you go broke."
177t"I ordered a Philly Beef Sandwich from Domino's Pizza in North Brach MN ON 10/24/2022. STAFF WAS FRIENDLY. My question is WHERE'S THE BEEF? Very sparse amount of Beef in this sandwich, in fact there was more cheese than anything. Terrible quality."
178t"The managers routinely stole my online delivery tips and were very bold about doing so. When 1 of the managers was informed she also began to also steal my tips. Theives at Michigan Store 1085 on Plymouth Road."
179t"25 SEP 22 I picked up a carry-out order from Dominos store #3551, located at 132 Tuckahoe Rd in Yonkers, NY. Upon entering the establishment, I witnessed the 2 staff members in the back of the store preparing food with their bare-hands. The members were touching the uncooked meats, cheeses & vegetables whilst adjusting their clothes and hair. The practice was incredibly unsanitary, cross-contaminating the food and no one seems to care. I reached out to Domino's that same night via email, it has been 25 days and I have heard nothing since from the company. This matter needs to be addressed immediately for the safety of the consumers."
180t"The thing that tops my experience is the SUPERB customer service. Arrick is beyond amazing and is the reason we will be back! He made sure my order was correct and I had everything I need. He is respectful and professional. The app ordering was simple and easy and the food is consistently tasty."
181t"If you drive by a Domino's Pizza and get a sudden craving, go to any other pizza store, because you will be penalized for ordering in-store. They want you to order online. You need to plan your visit."
182t"I ordered two pizzas for takeaway and garlic breadsticks..After I reached home I saw my second pizza was wrong one and after eating first one it felt like it was made long before I gave my order. Hardly any taste."
183t"9/10/22 I order chicken wings and salad and waiting for my order to be delivered and never showed. Call them to see and they snapped and said I would have to come and pick up. I said no and to deliver my damn order and they claimed they already did and that was a lie. 975 Grand Ave Saint Paul Mn 55105 needs to be shut down immediately. Poor service, poor management, poor staff, sad. So stay away from this location if you can. They don’t deserve customers or anything but a shutdown."
184t"I have order from Domino’s in Kimberly WI numerous times and always have had issues. After waiting for 1 hour and 37 min for our dinner and being dissatisfied with the service and the quality of the product Today I am taking the time to write my first review ever because I am tired of this. Our pizza came without cheese and the pasta looked like it was eaten out of. I will never order from this location again. If I could give less stars I would and if I could attach a picture I would."
185t"Me and my wife was told they didn’t have change for a 100$ then was told that they don’t take bills bigger than a 50$ then I was asked to hand back the food that was already in my car and was told to go get some small bills and and come back. Will never go back."
186t"I spent 20 minutes navigating their app to order dinner, consider the pop-up offers to add things, etc. Two minutes later the store manager calls me to say their store can only do pick-up orders for the rest of the night due to a driver shortage. Regardless whether I cancel altogether or switch to pick-up, she'll have to cancel my payment, which won't be refunded for 72 hrs. I ordered pizza in the 1st place because my week is so busy that there's little chance I'll remember to check for my refund in 72 hrs. Also, I have now spent the money I planned to spend tonight, on delivery, but I still have to order dinner. If my Kroger app can tell me my favorite salsa is available at the store near my kid's school, but not the one near our house, I don't accept that Domino's is incapable of warning me that I can't order delivery from my neighborhood store tonight... BEFORE they take my money."
187t"Once in a blue moon I think of having pizza, so today I ordered it from Domino's to have it in my lunch. At 3:41pm I ordered it and waited for 2 long hours and no delivery was made. There wasn't any response from the restaurant and the app just showed that my order will be delivered shortly. This is how the service of Domino's Pizza has degraded soo much. I will never order again, please stay away from mental harassment people."
188t"Okay so about a month and a half ago I ordered food for $41 and some cents and I never received it. So I did get it refunded but at the end of the day the manager call me back 3 days ago and offered me two free pizzas and said that they will be available to me at any time but the day before I tried yesterday and there's always an issue so now I have to pay a delivery fee. So I didn't have the money for which I don't think I need delivery fee because the food was supposed to be delivered and I never got it so that should be included. "
189t"I'm very disgusted and disappointed with my pizza. I don't usually go to Domino's but rather Pizza Hut. We saw there was 50% off pizzas and wanted to get some.  But that was horrible idea. I didn't have Domino's that long ago and it was absolutely amazing! But this.. This was a nightmare! We didn't have anymore money afterwards to get more food so that was the only thing we had in our fridge. It gave me food poisoning and made me vomit. You also got my order wrong. I asked for bacon not sausage on my pizza and medium sauce not high. And let me tell you one final thing the garbage from the dumpster from Kwik Trip tastes a lot better than your food. (Sorry for all capitals)."
190t"They never sent our food then they wanted to send us food food. Worst customer service ever. I ordered. They sent it to wrong address then the way they wanted to help was to send us cold food. Not a good fix. Nobody wants cold lunch then they said they called but didn’t call my phone."
191t"Ordered pizza at 5:20. It's 8:37 now and it still hasn't arrived. Tried calling store numerous times but get no answer. Called customer service number and they tried to contact the store with no luck. She couldn't cancel the order or give me a refund. Said I would have to file a complaint."
192t"I ordered two pizzas online, for delivery from Dominos Pizza, in Albany, Louisiana with the coupon of 50% off full menu price. Delivery guy arrived, but without avail, there was no transaction. Delivery guy proceeded to call store manager and she did not honor the coupon, stating that the coupon is only available for carry-out. Pizzas were returned to store, after I tried to pay the amount advertised. Nowhere in Dominos coupon does it stipulate that the coupon is only valid for carry-out. Please see advertised coupon https://www.dominos.com/en/pages/order/coupon."
193t"I called Domino's Pizza this evening and tried to order 2 large pizzas and cheesy bread and was told the price would be $53 plus with tax and delivery charge. I gasped and said, ""What about the $7.99 pizzas you have been advertising?"" I was told that only applies if you order online. I said, ""Well I'm canceling the order, as I have experienced my card information being stolen with online orders more than 3 times just last year alone."" The lady said, ""Well I can give you 2 large pizzas and cheesy bread for $30 plus,"" I laughed and said, ""I cancel the cheesy bread, where are we at now,"" she said the best she could do was $20 plus for 2 large pizzas."
194t"I order a steak and cheese sandwich and they sent a bread with burned cheese, no steak. Called manager to replace it, she gave me the excuse that the order said only plain. I explain in detail. Again she gave me the excuse of the plain order."
195t"I placed a call-in, for pick up order for a single Medium Extravaganza pizza at 7:07pm on Sat 8/13/22 in Port Lavaca, TX and was told it would be ready in about 15 min. I arrived at 7:20pm and was told it would be ready in a couple minutes. I paid for it and stepped aside. I noticed a single Medium pizza box on the ""Order out"" shelf with a Ticket tapped to the box. The cashier looked at it but grabbed another order off of the same shelf and handed it to a customer waiting at the counter. This same scenario went on for about 5 more minutes. She looked at the ticket on the Medium Pizza box but removed and delivered a different order and continued to work doing her other duties. I suspected she was looking at my order but not giving it to me, so I asked her about it. Sure enough, it was my pizza. She gave it to me apologizing. I took it home to eat. The Pizza had cooled off so much it was like eating ""Day old Pizza"". That will be my Last Domino's order."
196t"Yesterday I ordered online to Domino’s app 2 veg pizza, but domino’s delivered nonveg pizza to me. My family is pure vegetarian. My religious sentiments were deeply hurt. I tried to contact domino’s. I want compensation for this blunder mistake. They told me that they will send same order within half an hour, and half refund will given. After some time same order was delivered but no refund issued. I just want compensation, apology, refund. What is the cost of religious sentiments to anyone?"
197t"Picked up an order for the first time since our move. If I can upload a picture, no words will be required for the burnt chicken order. The other items were normal and acceptable. I guess the details aren't important for all items."
198t"I called Monday, just before 6:00pm. I ordered my pizza with a pie cut and no oregano. My receipt even says to cut it like a pie. The tracker showed that my pizza was taken out of the oven at 6:27 and ""quality checked"". My order was delivered at 6:52pm. Upon opening the box, my pizza came to me in pieces and had oregano on it. I WILL NOT eat pieces of pizza. It was cut into squares. "
199t"I ordered garlic knots as a late night snack, since Domino's is the only local food joint nearby that is open late. After eating the garlic knots, that barely had garlic flavor, I became sick. I found myself hallucinating and quite doped out. This does not happen when I eat. I feel cheated and am concerned about the sanitary environment of Domino's; as well as drugged suspicion."
200t"Do NOT go to the Domino's Pizza store in Hoover Alabama on Lorna Road!!! I repeat, do NOT go there!!! I ordered the coupon special of 2 medium pizzas. One thin for my wife and a medium pepperoni special with mushrooms for me. When I got home there were NO mushrooms and I paid $9.95 for a medium. I called to let them know there were no mushrooms. They do NOT answer the phone!!! While on hold, I am hearing that I can get a large 3 topping pizza for $7.99 each. What a ripoff and remember, I paid $9.95 for something less."
201t"Just an FYI. The $3.99 to $4.99 delivery charge is not for the driver/ delivery person. The company keeps it. This is terrible as I thought it was part of their tip. Domino’s should be ashamed of themselves."
202t"The app/website is always working properly when I’m using it to make a purchase. I log in fine and have no issues. Anytime I attempt to redeem the pizza I’ve earned I am met with utter disappointment. When I open the app I'm always logged in, when I select to redeem a pizza it says verify your password. This is where the circle of death starts. You enter in your password and it either says incorrect or account locked. You hit reset password, no email is sent. This goes on and on for the better part of 20mins or until you give up. If you don’t want people to redeem the free pizza then simply do offer it."
203t"Hello, I have placed an order from Domino's app today, the delivery person cancelled the order and ruined the happiness which we are going to celebrate, when I tried to call the outlet manager they told me they have some policies under which a delivery person (Mr. **) can cancel the delivery without customer confirmation, how can a delivery person has the authority to cancel the order. Also, the delivery boy has unprofessional behaviour on the call after asking, ""Why you have cancelled the order."" "
204t"They make customer foolish.. Very bad taste. Stomach infection. Very very bad totally. Money wastage. Many customers in front me who did order return without food because they were not able to give timely. So poor quality."
205t"Ordered pizza and garlic bread like usual and the food was left on the ground and covered with ants! We never gave instructions to leave pizza on porch! Was given another pizza and never even ate it! Very disappointing!"
206t"I ordered Domino's delivery online and was offered a coupon. I added my delivery information when prompted. During the process I was offered one add-on for a discount under the coupon. When I got to check-out, it said I could not add-on and the price went from $5.99 + whatever the add-on was, to $26.24. I was hungry I proceeded unhappily. The site offered status of my order with choices. I Amazon Alexa. Alexa confirmed."
207t"I ordered pizza for my family. Not only was the pizza never delivered but the money was taken out of my account not once but twice! Called and spoke to the manager who yelled at me because so many people where had called and I was the one that got it even though I was saying it's ok, it's not your fault! But being that everyone who had called was so ignorant by the time I called it was, I have been seeing you calling and I'm trying to fix the problem. What else do I want me to do.... And I'm saying it's ok, calm down, you're fine, she is yelling and yeah my door slammed and she got the momma bear!! I have yet to get a call or my money or food. Dominos wtf my Money"
208t"I called to complain. I was told I would get a replacement. But the employee did not put in a book. So I m told. When I called for a replacement they told me there is no record and too bad for me. They do keep word not. Don't go there!"
209t"Their customer service is nonexistent. Have been writing to them for over a month as I never received the $3.00 tip advertised on TV. Only response I got was ""order timed out"". Won't even tell me what that means. It's too bad as they have a good product but for $3.00 they will not see me in any of their stores!"
210t"Received unlawful and bad service. Wrote to Dominos Corp around 3/16/2022. No reply as of yet. Please see below. It's definitely ground for a legal action.I have few coupons from SaveAround coupon book that I had been purchasing for the last 10 or so years to support local High Schools. One of the coupons that the book has is from Domino’s (buy any, one or more toping large pizza, and get another free of equal or lesser value), and there’s no restriction whatsoever. Besides buying other stuff throughout the year from Domino’s, I had been using this coupon to buy one spatiality pizza (it has more than one topping) at the regular menu price and get another one for free as indicated."
211t"Call the West Main Street Domino's in Meriden Connecticut and order a large pepperoni pizza and when I get there they were arguing with me that it was a medium pepperoni. Wrong. The lady who I even spoke with said my order back to me. They claim they record calls. Well check my call recording. I'm pissed. This place in Meriden is such a joke. They need to learn to hire people that know how to do their job."
212t"I ordered pizza online for pickup. When I came into the store the pizza was already done. I paid my bill. There were four people standing around the guy that took my money, walked away and then I waited for 10 minutes until an employee that worked all the time noticed that the pizza was not given to me. What a bad customer service and the poor lady that was working while all the other guys were just standing around doing nothing."
213t"Well, that massive and creative marketing campaign about a $3 tip isn't really a tip. Domino's saves on gas and employees, but you don't save anything unless you are buying pizza every 7 days. Yep, your ""tip"" expires in 7 days. Isn't this false or misleading advertising? If I give a driver $3 tip, does it just disappear from his/her pocket in 3 days (probably, but you know what I mean)?"
214t"Welp!! I didn't get my wings I so badly wanted at the time. Too bad I can't post my pictures. HIGHLY disappointed. 2 large hand tossed, bread twist, 8pc WINGS PLAIN, 2 2-liters... Got everything right but THE WINGS!! Gave me two boxes of Garlic Bread twist."
215t"Ordered from Dominoes in FT Lauderdale FL Online. Oder said processing, two hours later card was charged and site still said prepping order. Tried to call store and sat on hold for an hour. WORST service I have ever had would not recommend to Anyone."
216t"AUSTIN IN CASTLE HAYNE NC HAS A VERY RUDE AND NEGATIVE ATTITUDE WITH REPEAT CUSTOMERS. VERY BAD. PLEASE LET HIM GO. He refuses to give out his name. Will NOT give out corporate phone number for fear of being reported. He told his employees not to give out manager name or corporate phone number, that if I want corporate number I have to go to store."
217t"I used to order as a last resort when starving. But pizza has gotten saltier and saltier. Pure salt. But what really turned me off from the company is how they just went on an attack in the delivery drivers by promoting to tip the customer $3 if they pick up their own food. They always charge ridiculous made up fees. False advertise on prices. Always mess up orders. Bad on the phone. But to see that they don’t even care or take care of their own workers sealed it. Never again I give them business."
218t"Ordered a large pizza well done and it was burnt black on edges and sausage was too hard and black also. Took a piece back to verify and manager said this is what well done looks like. I have ordered this before and it has never been like this. Pizza was inedible! New manager does not know what pizza should look like. Very poor customer service!"
219t"No don't. Gave me headache and puked on eating. Order placed yesterday and gave me stale food and I got sick and puked. The whole order is in garbage. Even the garbage disposal service is asking of 100 units to dispose on top of 400 units paid for. And needless to say got to bed hungry."
220t"Whoever changed the prices recently, I just want to talk. Example: the chocolate lava cakes use to be $3.99 for 2. Now they're $6.99 for 3. So you get 1 more cake and have to pay the same price for 2 twice. I don't know. Maybe it's just me loving food too much, but that's unfair to me and I'm disappointed. Haha."
221t"My family had the best delivery driver experience ever on Easter of 2023. The pizza was incredible. The service was fast. I would give it a 20 star rating if I could. The driver was extremely polite. I have never had service like that in my life. I wish I got his name. Excellent service. Thanks Domino's."
222t"The Domino's in Tuscumbia, AL is by far the best anywhere around here! They have the best customer service and when I called about my missing pizza, the manager I spoke with, Leslie, was super nice and had no issues with correcting the mistake. I am a loyal customer for life thanks to her!"
223t"OH, this restaurant is So worth it. I mean listen. They put the most effort into their food than any other restaurant I have ever been to. The crust was nothing like ever before. You know Pizza Hut, they have crunchy regular crusts the boring part of the pizza oh but Domino's? It was crunchy on the outside and soft and delicious on the inside. The pepperoni was crunchy and flavorful. And Oh My Gosh the cinnamon twists dipped in the served icing was the best dessert,  completing perfect satisfaction to meet my requirements. And overall this fantastic restaurant is a must-go and I will forever eat there."
224t"I ordered stuffed cheesy bread for a change and it was absolutely worth of every penny! It was so cheesy and satisfying. The cheese was so stringy when you were taking pieces apart and was so satisfying. I absolutely recommend it to others. Their advertisement matches to the quality of their product. I bought it from 1171 Upper James location."
225t"Assistant was very Professional and understood my complaint to the fullest with no attitude…Got right to the problem at hand and rectified the situation without it going overboard or to the next level, my problem was heard and not just given attitude, very, very Professional. 10/10 that that she resolved my problem and rectified the situation without further speaking to a higher figure!"
226t"For the second time in the history of New Castle, IN’s luxury offerings, the city has opened another Domino’s Pizza restaurant (not since 199x has the city had a Domino’s). And though this new Domino’s started out actually putting an effort into making quality food, it has quickly gone downhill in the few months it has been opened. Not only does the “online orders only” coupons never work when attempting to use them, but the food which one pays full price for is so terrible that a person seriously would be better off going elsewhere. "
227t"Domino's completely reduced their quality of their pizza to a point it's as lost inedible. Extremely dry. The Philly cheese steak only had a few burnt flakes on it. They cut it now thinner than paper I swear. The mushroom pizza was pathetic too. I swear they only used one mushroom the size of a dime on the entire pizza and that's being generous. They lost this customer forever. Auf Wiedersehen."
228t"Online ordering is crap. Only way to get the good specials is online. Both me and my wife can't make it happen and same with our neighbors. Causes to go to Pizza Hut. Domino's needs to do something to fix this."
229t"I will not order the tots again. They were soggy and not edible at all. Maybe if they were more crispy it would have been better. But not my experience with them. Maybe after time they will get it right."
230t"When I walked in the employee said ''hello what would you like today?'' Then I just got the best pepperoni pizza of my life. So good. The pizza was not burned. it was the way I like my pizza and I think everyone else would like it too."
231t"Friday March 24th I think, I went online and ordered a pizza for 2:15 and when I went to pick it up I arrived at 2:17 and it was brought outside curbside and handed to me and 5 minutes back to the house I opened it to have a slice in my friends that there's. It was cold as ice like it had been made 6 hours before or something. It tasted like leather. We had to throw it out and go to Angelotti's. It sucked.. It appeared that they had fixed the pizza 2 hours before and left it there until I came out because it is ice cold and tasted leathery. It was the worst Pizza that Domino's has ever given me and it is the worst service I've ever had there. They ought to be ashamed of themselves and bringing something like that out to a person. I only live 5 minutes from them if that and it was a specialty pizza and it was bad and I mean severely bad I'm not even exaggerating..."
232t"I order cheese steak pizza. It was the worst ever had. It was burnt. Yes they replace that order but still was awful. Didn't taste like cheese steak which was my favorite pizza from there. Never again will I order from there. Worst experience ever. They are replacing something on the pizza so it'll cost just as much more than it's worth. I know just because I'm one person they probably don't ever care."
233t"Today I shopped at 2265 Towne Lake Pkwy #104, Woodstock, GA 30189 And my order was cold and without any quality. The 6 cheese Pizza didn't have 6 cheese, it tasted awful. We ordered a stuffed bread and it had no fillings. We paid $40 dollars for bad quality. I am very sad about the quality that was once very good, but today I do not recommend and do not buy from this place anymore. A lot of disrespect for the customer."
234t"On Thursday, March 16, 2023, at approximately 4:45pm I placed a order for pizza. At approximately 6:00 I noticed that my pizza had not arrived. I then called customer service to see if I could get some answers as to the status of my order. The customer service representative stated that they only took orders and were unable to track my order. I was then advised to call the local store to speak with someone concerning my order. I then called the local Dominos located in Lauderdale Lakes Fl, The phone rang and with a advertised recording playing. I was on hold for more than 30 minutes. I hung up the phone and decided to choose a different place for my family and I to have our meal. "
235t"A Domino's Pizza in Jacksonville, Florida messed up my order and delivered pizzas with no toppings at all. Then they took more from my account than the amount of the bill. It's been a month and they have refused to respond and refund my money."
236t"Prior to my recent online order on March 11, I had nothing bad to say about Domino's. I had ordered two times before this date. Everything that I ordered before was good. My order on March 11, however, wasn't good at all. My pizza was barely sliced and was very greasy. My tater tots tasted as if they were old. All that was on the tater tots were cheddar cheese and bacon. I'm not sure what the white sauce is, whether it's some type of cheese, but I didn't receive any white sauce as displayed in the picture on their website. The bacon was hard and burnt. The ONLY thing that was good were the three chocolate cakes that I ordered. These I love as this makes the third time I ordered them."
237t"I've ordered Domino's Pizza in NC and FL, they deliver up to 20 minutes or more away normally. They're less than 10 minutes away, but say they won't deliver. Yet advertise a day on my TV and will deliver them say..**!!!!"
238t"I understand with the economy, Domino's has to charge for Delivery. They also add more to the price of the food you're ordering. They even add more to the price depending on what crust you choose for the pizza. So to skip the $5.00 Delivery fee, the $1.99 crust fee, and the Extra $1.00 per pizza, I ordered plain, and picked it up myself. So, If I go pick up my own $40 order, WTF! Why am I being asked to leave a tip: 10%, 15%, 20% or $4, $6, $8? That's why I'm picking it up because you've lost my delivery service, do you really want to lose my pickup service also! At my job no one ever says I'm going to get my salary and depending on how well I do, maybe a 20% Tip!"
239t"I didn’t even order Domino's or go in. This is a full on personal experience, while driving with my fiancé, our 2 children in the back seat. A driver pulled out in front of us with maybe 20 feet to spare. We had to slam on our breaks so hard our daughter hit her head against the door even while buckled in. We almost slid into oncoming traffic and was almost hit head on to miss the delivery driver. HORRIBLE. IF YOURE GOING TO BE A DELIVERY BUSINESS HAVE SOMEONE WORTH A ** DRIVING!!!! Bad business just to “just talk to the driver” like the manager said he would. What if my kids would have been killed or injured??? To deliver a pizza to a dispensary. Horrible. Will never go to Domino's again."
240t"I have ordered pizza from Domino's for forty years. I will never order another one. The last pan pizza I bought looked like cheese soup. Looked like there was no crust. Almost like it was soaked in water!! It was disgusting. There's no way they didn't know it looked like ** when it was delivered. NEVER AGAIN!"
241t"Order online. Great experience one night. Next time order canceled and told outside service area. Tell the truth. Back to Marco's for me. They answer the phone and actually appear to want the business."
242t"Store #3862, located on 900 S Federal Highway Fort Lauderdale, FL 33316, is the worst store I've ever tried ordering from before. They deliver until 1 AM, so it says on their site, but despite that, even though we tried ordering delivery before even 12 AM, they accepted our order, let it say they were prepping it for about fifteen to twenty minutes, and then cancelled our order on us. We tried calling a couple times and were stuck on hold for over half an hour, tried ordering again, and it got cancelled again, even though we ordered over fifty dollars of food for our family. "
243t"After debating on even whether to order out for a pizza I decided to make the order on the internet. It said it would be done by 9:12. At 9:02 it said it was ready. I drove around the block. All the parking spots were full that I could get my F-150 into. When they were supposed to have had the pizza to my truck already I called. They come outside they go back inside then they come out and say, ""Park your truck and we'll bring your pizza out."" I said, ""Keep your pizza. I've been sitting out here for 2 minutes. You should already had it out here."" "
244t"I just made my last trip to Domino's EVER!! I did not order the Pizza, but I did last week and it is horrible! Tasteless crust, very little cheese, marinara sauce that is too sweet, and pepperoni with no flavor. Today was the worst! I live in Buffalo NY and know that you get the best Buffalo Wings from our local restaurants, NOT national chains. The ONLY reason I ordered Buffalo wings from Domino's is I had a gift card to use up. I ordered 32 Buffalo Wings along with 4 Blue Cheese cups for $36. Ladies and Gentlemen, Domino's should be permanently shut down for how bad these wings were. Forget deep fried or even an Air Fryer/Convection oven to make the wings crispy. The wings were baked. The skin was rubbery. The wings were so small that I felt sorry for the flock of Pidgeon's who gave their life for this horrendous order. "
245t"I was not happy with an order I received. I made a complaint and was promised a refund. I have still not received any refund! These people make the worst so called pizza and then don't live up to their refund promise! It's sickening!"
246t"We ordered a Hawaiian pizza, and 2 more items, cost was almost $45, we were supposed to get it by 6:32 pm today and the app tracker said the delivery was completed around 6:40 pm but we never got it, even that we put the instructions where to leave the order and all that, my daughter had to call the store to let them know, by the time the delivery driver was arriving to the store and he told my daughter in which apartment number he left our order and asked her if she wanted him to bring it to our place or if we we're fine. I told my daughter to tell him to bring it to our apartment as the original instructions we requested, anyways long story short the driver never apologize for the misplaced and we ended up with a cold pizza and other items delivered freaking late, poor service and it was a bad experience for us."
247t"Worst and most frustrating online website ordering system ever. Not my first experience with issues on this website. Definitely not very user friendly. Just wanted to redeem a free medium two topping pizza voucher I received for buying a $25 gift card. Now I'll have to go back."
248t"The promotional ad that says you will receive a three dollar tip for picking up your own pizza is total garbage. It is a three dollar coupon that expires in one week. All that means is you need to order another pizza within a week. That is not a tip! A tip should be a three dollar refund when you pick up your own pizza!"
249t"I completed and online order January 11, 2023 I inadvertently ordered a pizza from the Mountain Veiw CA store in error. I was in Cypress TX at the time. I TRIED CALL the Mountain veiw Store for hours total 10 call, no answer however some calls did go to the call center which they could not help. No one answered my calls or even return them. Call Domino's so call Customer support, spoke with a guy, explain my story, then he indicated they would get with the store and refund the monies charged. There has been no follow through, no one to contact at Domino support just a voice mail used the Bot for a return call nothing... no call or response. I've waste so much time on this which has lead me to write poor review all over the internet and tell as many friends as possible. THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE CUSTOMER. THEY JUST WANT TO TAKE YOUR MONEY!!!!"
250t"PLEASE DON'T CHEAT YOUR CUSTOMERS. Today I order at 11:26am & my order was delivered at 12:10pm, according to '30 minutes delivery guarantee' my order should be free. But when I tell them about late delivery they show 'Apologies! Your Order is not applicable for Service Guarantee.' and delivery time is showing 11:53am. They even send me SMS at 11:52 about delay in delivery. You don't want to give free pizza & stick to your policy. At least stop making fool out of your customers."
251t"Ordered a pizza for Delivery from Domino's Pizza in Midland, MI. Unbeknownst to me, my doorbell no longer works. Of course, as luck would have it, the Domino's Delivery Driver rang the door bell. I did not answer, so driver left the pizza box on my porch. After my third call to the store I was finally notified pizza box was on the porch. About 30 minutes after the driver left it, I got my pizza and of course it was cold. Why couldn't the driver have simply knocked on the door? Additionally, they put jalapeno peppers on the pizza which I did not order. Asked for refund, but was denied. I will never order from them again and neither should you."
252t"The recent pizza from Dominos was a sham and a shame! The crust was dry overdone, not really edible. My dog wouldn't eat it either! The so-called three toppings were barely visible - onions, mushrooms, pepperoni was so scant, it was simply sad! The sauce too was now hot! Someone decided everyone likes their mouths on fire apparently."
253t"This is a worst place. Very rude and inhumane customer service. Nobody should be treated this way. I can't believe this store even exist in USA. I am ** immigrant myself but I am sorry if this is the kinda culture we are adopting and heading toward, the future of USA doesn't look bright to me. Jan 1 2023, After working 12 hours, I got to this store at around 7-8 p.m, and ordered buffalo chicken pizza with pineapple toppings worth $20. They ask me to wait 10-15 min, I waited more than 20 min. That's fine. I took the pizza and drove home. "
254t"Domino’s was always a consistent, yummy treat when we could get to the city. But whatever changes they made with the crust and sauce are not good. Yuck. What a disappointment. It also doesn’t reheat very well at all. Back to Papa John's I go!"
255t"Received a burnt pizza and pasta and manager on duty Nena at the West Spring Creek location in Plano TX who I was able to record on my phone refused to send another order out stating we will just complain again and she rather refund the money. After asking several times to redo order she still refused and said to call back almost 2 hours later to speak with her General Manager Kat **…. I have never experienced such horrible food and ridiculous “customer service”."
256t"Picked up a pizza from Domino's today. It was lacking the marinara and cheese. They somehow remembered to put on pepperoni which was kind of them. I'm not sure if the workers there are angry at management or they company or customers or all of the above but it will be the last time I ever order from Domino's. I'll be sharing my experience with everyone that I ever see looking to order food. Say goodbye to your revenues."
257t"We ordered pizza yesterday from website online. We received the discount of RS.300 but when the pizza got delivered they charged us extra amount and when we called the store manager he directly refused to take responsibility of the extra payment and started speaking rudely on the call. When we contacted customer service they mentioned no extra amount should be charged. Still store manager took extra money."
258t"I have tried to contact a person in customer service. There is no way to do this. Avoid any company that knows its product is so horrible, that they do not even offer customer service. I will never, ever, order from Domino's again."
259t"This pizza is SO delicious for the price. They have REALLY upped the bar from the Domino's I had growing up!! Loaded with fresh toppings. I such great customer service too! I messed up my order on a busy night - they happily remade my pizza, quickly without hesitation."
260t"I received a coupon for a free medium 2 topping pizza. However, there is a minimum $15 purchase for delivery and the coupon required that the Pizza had to be delivered! So really unless you were already planning on spending at least $15 dollars, the coupon Is worthless. I wouldn’t have minded a delivery fee, but spending $15 for a not so free $6.99 pizza?"
261t"Placed order at 6:27 pm, delivered at 7:02 pm, missing parts of order. Driver said he would retrieve missing items from store. Called 1303 King St E, Oshawa store at 7:22 to confirm if driver had retrieved missing items. Manager said she would print new bill and send out missing items. It is now 8:11 pm and have received nothing more. Will be deleting the app and no longer be ordering from Domino's any more for this extremely disappointing experience."
262t"Stay away from here. Horrible customer service. Horrible food. I only ordered a pizza and garlic knots, for it to take 2 hours just to come cold, with no sauce, garlic knots were so damn greasy. It was just gross. Called to speak with manager, one of the associates picked up and said they had too many orders and it was nothing she could do with so much sass. I told her, ""I called to speak to a manager. Obviously there’s nothing you can do."" No apologies or nothing. She had me on hold then hung up. Called again, got a manager and I told him I just wanted a refund and that my pizza didn’t even come with sauce! No apology no nothing!"
263t"Tried using their ""any specialty pizza for $16.99"" tonight. Wouldn't honor it, kept ringing in at $18.99. Watch your bills with this company, not very reputable doing deceptive marketing. This coupon was on the Domino's site."
264t"Today 23rd Nov 22 we visited Domino’s Pizza at Andheri East near Hubtown Solaris outlet. Ordered two medium size thin crust veg pizza, to our surprise the pizza base was completely burned black. After informing the manager he asked us casually whether we need other one but did not bother to check the pizza or gave us any pizza. We waited for 15 mins for him to come But there was utterly no response and very vague attitude language by Domino's person. This led to a very negative situation to visit the brand again. I wasted my time, money and taste with my experience at Domino's."
265t"All employees are disrespect their customers, I guess it's management problems or there are no management at all, also I guess it's discrimination against some customers especially for elderly people, it's my fault that I buy Domino's, I will switch to Pizza Hut."
266t"Please don’t order any pepperoni cheese pizza from this location. This weekend the pepperoni pizza is not good. My husband and son was poison last night. They vomiting and strong stomach pain after they eat pepperoni pizza from Domino last night. They still not recovered. I order a free coupon pizza and it looks like Domino use old expired pepperoni for free promotion coupon."
267t"This is the worst company I've ever dealt with. They delivered my order 3 hours late, missing 2/3 items and the delivery driver laughed at me. They basically stole from me. Can't contact anyone at the location or office. This is the worst, most garbage business I've ever encountered. Still no response from the company or ability to speak with a human. Trash."
268t"We ordered Domino's for the 1st time in a while. My daughter loves the garlic bites. We order those and 2 garlic sauces. Which we paid extra for. When it was delivered after they left we realize we got no sauces not even the marinara that comes with it. We called to let them know. They said they would run it over and never showed. So disappointing."
269t"Great experience, the food was delicious and the girl was really patient and polite. Will come back for sure & will also refer to my friends & other who come across in my daily life. I hope you guys get these kind of employees."
270t"Ordered by phone, the call center are Foreigners and hard to understand and can't understand a SIMPLE DAMN PIZZA ORDER. When I went to pick it up it was COLD, all kind of BLACK STUFF in pizza box. These kids don't know how to sweep out the oven. The Cinnamon Twist didn't have icing in the box. This happens all the time. The menu states 1 icing. They always leave it OUT. This is DUE TO TWO THING 1. Either the EMPLOYEES are IDIOTS. 2. THE MANAGERS ARE IDIOTS BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO TRAIN THE EMPLOYEES. From all the problems coming out of the MACON GA, FORSYTH RD STORE THE COMPANY NEEDS TO GET NEW MANAGERS."
271t"We have enjoyed pizza here in the past, however, when I got there to pick it up I did notice that it was busier than usual, not sure if that impacted the pizza we ordered...when we got home our pizza was burnt, and just tasted terrible. We are not sure what the problem was but we will take our business elsewhere."
272t"We just ordered Pizza, wings, salads, and sodas from the store at: 2700 Carlisle Road York, PA 17408. I have ordered from this store in the past and not experienced any issues with our orders. However, tonight was a different kind of experience. I placed the order and had it delivered out of convenience with having a house full of family. Our order came to $100 and when it was delivered they brought 3 20oz sodas opposed to the 3 2litters we ordered. Called back and spoke to the manager, Jenny [from the block] who exhibited zero good customer service skills. Jenny made no effort to resolve the error, outside of asking if we would like to purchase additional sodas. This will be our last order from this store and possibly Dominos altogether. This is definitely not the same Dominos with customer service oriented policies and protocols. We highly recommend that you do not use this business!!!"
273t"Domino's - a well know Pizza brand have served me very badly last month. I ordered 1 pizza & 1 coco lava (my 1 of the most fav. from their menu), but I only received Pizza, coco lava - was MISSING. I raised complaint many times, tried reaching customer care too every time they promised resolution with 24 hrs. but 'til I haven't received a single call from them not my refund. I ordered from Domino's app which is my biggest, if I would have done from Swiggy or Zomato - I must have received instant refund. I LOST TRUST IN YOU DOMINO's."
274t"We normally get our hoagies from Foxe's or Vocelli pizza but we wanted to try the new Dominos...Should of listened to the horrible reviews from friends and other people! We ordered a Philly steak ""sandwich""..When I was handed this tiny box I knew I was going to be disappointed..It was just burned cheese and a FEW burned peppers.. Absolutely no mushrooms or maybe there were. Couldn't tell since it was completely burnt. ABSOLUTELY NO TYPE OF MEAT! I can guarantee this business will be belly up w/in a year. The reviews and comments from people are just disappointed and rip off of their money and time. I can't even go to their website to make a complaint. Didn't even bother calling the business...since others have said they were just refused when attempting to either get a refund or something else in the place of what they messed up for the order..DO NOT GO TO NORTH APOLLO DOMINO'S PIZZA!!"
275t"I have never had an issue until today... Domino's Pizza has incremented prices but decreased quality, today I ordered a ham and pineapple pizza and besides being cold, it had so much sauce that it was impossible to eat due being soggy and cloying, also the box was full of grease. After being a loyal customer for a few years, today was the last time that I ordered, I sent my complain to them via online and they offered me a free pizza or 20% discount but to be honest all I wanted is to be reimbursed."
276t"I ordered dinner delivered from Domino's, Gymea, for my family at a cost of $70. Three hours later dinner still hadn't arrived. I tried to call repeatedly but staff were ignoring the phone. So I went into Domino's to complain. I was offered a refund which I was told would take two days to return to my bank account. Well It's been one month and despite repeated phone calls and promises the refund will be in my account 'tomorrow' I am still waiting. Never again Domino's. I am about to call Consumer Affairs and complain about you. I hope you go broke."
277t"I ordered a Philly Beef Sandwich from Domino's Pizza in North Brach MN ON 10/24/2022. STAFF WAS FRIENDLY. My question is WHERE'S THE BEEF? Very sparse amount of Beef in this sandwich, in fact there was more cheese than anything. Terrible quality."
278t"The managers routinely stole my online delivery tips and were very bold about doing so. When 1 of the managers was informed she also began to also steal my tips. Theives at Michigan Store 1085 on Plymouth Road."
279t"25 SEP 22 I picked up a carry-out order from Dominos store #3551, located at 132 Tuckahoe Rd in Yonkers, NY. Upon entering the establishment, I witnessed the 2 staff members in the back of the store preparing food with their bare-hands. The members were touching the uncooked meats, cheeses & vegetables whilst adjusting their clothes and hair. The practice was incredibly unsanitary, cross-contaminating the food and no one seems to care. I reached out to Domino's that same night via email, it has been 25 days and I have heard nothing since from the company. This matter needs to be addressed immediately for the safety of the consumers."
280t"The thing that tops my experience is the SUPERB customer service. Arrick is beyond amazing and is the reason we will be back! He made sure my order was correct and I had everything I need. He is respectful and professional. The app ordering was simple and easy and the food is consistently tasty."
281t"If you drive by a Domino's Pizza and get a sudden craving, go to any other pizza store, because you will be penalized for ordering in-store. They want you to order online. You need to plan your visit."
282t"I ordered two pizzas for takeaway and garlic breadsticks..After I reached home I saw my second pizza was wrong one and after eating first one it felt like it was made long before I gave my order. Hardly any taste."
283t"9/10/22 I order chicken wings and salad and waiting for my order to be delivered and never showed. Call them to see and they snapped and said I would have to come and pick up. I said no and to deliver my damn order and they claimed they already did and that was a lie. 975 Grand Ave Saint Paul Mn 55105 needs to be shut down immediately. Poor service, poor management, poor staff, sad. So stay away from this location if you can. They don’t deserve customers or anything but a shutdown."
284t"I have order from Domino’s in Kimberly WI numerous times and always have had issues. After waiting for 1 hour and 37 min for our dinner and being dissatisfied with the service and the quality of the product Today I am taking the time to write my first review ever because I am tired of this. Our pizza came without cheese and the pasta looked like it was eaten out of. I will never order from this location again. If I could give less stars I would and if I could attach a picture I would."
285t"Me and my wife was told they didn’t have change for a 100$ then was told that they don’t take bills bigger than a 50$ then I was asked to hand back the food that was already in my car and was told to go get some small bills and and come back. Will never go back."
286t"I spent 20 minutes navigating their app to order dinner, consider the pop-up offers to add things, etc. Two minutes later the store manager calls me to say their store can only do pick-up orders for the rest of the night due to a driver shortage. Regardless whether I cancel altogether or switch to pick-up, she'll have to cancel my payment, which won't be refunded for 72 hrs. I ordered pizza in the 1st place because my week is so busy that there's little chance I'll remember to check for my refund in 72 hrs. Also, I have now spent the money I planned to spend tonight, on delivery, but I still have to order dinner. If my Kroger app can tell me my favorite salsa is available at the store near my kid's school, but not the one near our house, I don't accept that Domino's is incapable of warning me that I can't order delivery from my neighborhood store tonight... BEFORE they take my money."
287t"Once in a blue moon I think of having pizza, so today I ordered it from Domino's to have it in my lunch. At 3:41pm I ordered it and waited for 2 long hours and no delivery was made. There wasn't any response from the restaurant and the app just showed that my order will be delivered shortly. This is how the service of Domino's Pizza has degraded soo much. I will never order again, please stay away from mental harassment people."
288t"Okay so about a month and a half ago I ordered food for $41 and some cents and I never received it. So I did get it refunded but at the end of the day the manager call me back 3 days ago and offered me two free pizzas and said that they will be available to me at any time but the day before I tried yesterday and there's always an issue so now I have to pay a delivery fee. So I didn't have the money for which I don't think I need delivery fee because the food was supposed to be delivered and I never got it so that should be included. "
289t"I'm very disgusted and disappointed with my pizza. I don't usually go to Domino's but rather Pizza Hut. We saw there was 50% off pizzas and wanted to get some.  But that was horrible idea. I didn't have Domino's that long ago and it was absolutely amazing! But this.. This was a nightmare! We didn't have anymore money afterwards to get more food so that was the only thing we had in our fridge. It gave me food poisoning and made me vomit. You also got my order wrong. I asked for bacon not sausage on my pizza and medium sauce not high. And let me tell you one final thing the garbage from the dumpster from Kwik Trip tastes a lot better than your food. (Sorry for all capitals)."
290t"They never sent our food then they wanted to send us food food. Worst customer service ever. I ordered. They sent it to wrong address then the way they wanted to help was to send us cold food. Not a good fix. Nobody wants cold lunch then they said they called but didn’t call my phone."
291t"Ordered pizza at 5:20. It's 8:37 now and it still hasn't arrived. Tried calling store numerous times but get no answer. Called customer service number and they tried to contact the store with no luck. She couldn't cancel the order or give me a refund. Said I would have to file a complaint."
292t"I ordered two pizzas online, for delivery from Dominos Pizza, in Albany, Louisiana with the coupon of 50% off full menu price. Delivery guy arrived, but without avail, there was no transaction. Delivery guy proceeded to call store manager and she did not honor the coupon, stating that the coupon is only available for carry-out. Pizzas were returned to store, after I tried to pay the amount advertised. Nowhere in Dominos coupon does it stipulate that the coupon is only valid for carry-out. Please see advertised coupon https://www.dominos.com/en/pages/order/coupon."
293t"I called Domino's Pizza this evening and tried to order 2 large pizzas and cheesy bread and was told the price would be $53 plus with tax and delivery charge. I gasped and said, ""What about the $7.99 pizzas you have been advertising?"" I was told that only applies if you order online. I said, ""Well I'm canceling the order, as I have experienced my card information being stolen with online orders more than 3 times just last year alone."" The lady said, ""Well I can give you 2 large pizzas and cheesy bread for $30 plus,"" I laughed and said, ""I cancel the cheesy bread, where are we at now,"" she said the best she could do was $20 plus for 2 large pizzas."
294t"I order a steak and cheese sandwich and they sent a bread with burned cheese, no steak. Called manager to replace it, she gave me the excuse that the order said only plain. I explain in detail. Again she gave me the excuse of the plain order."
295t"I placed a call-in, for pick up order for a single Medium Extravaganza pizza at 7:07pm on Sat 8/13/22 in Port Lavaca, TX and was told it would be ready in about 15 min. I arrived at 7:20pm and was told it would be ready in a couple minutes. I paid for it and stepped aside. I noticed a single Medium pizza box on the ""Order out"" shelf with a Ticket tapped to the box. The cashier looked at it but grabbed another order off of the same shelf and handed it to a customer waiting at the counter. This same scenario went on for about 5 more minutes. She looked at the ticket on the Medium Pizza box but removed and delivered a different order and continued to work doing her other duties. I suspected she was looking at my order but not giving it to me, so I asked her about it. Sure enough, it was my pizza. She gave it to me apologizing. I took it home to eat. The Pizza had cooled off so much it was like eating ""Day old Pizza"". That will be my Last Domino's order."
296t"Yesterday I ordered online to Domino’s app 2 veg pizza, but domino’s delivered nonveg pizza to me. My family is pure vegetarian. My religious sentiments were deeply hurt. I tried to contact domino’s. I want compensation for this blunder mistake. They told me that they will send same order within half an hour, and half refund will given. After some time same order was delivered but no refund issued. I just want compensation, apology, refund. What is the cost of religious sentiments to anyone?"
297t"Picked up an order for the first time since our move. If I can upload a picture, no words will be required for the burnt chicken order. The other items were normal and acceptable. I guess the details aren't important for all items."
298t"I called Monday, just before 6:00pm. I ordered my pizza with a pie cut and no oregano. My receipt even says to cut it like a pie. The tracker showed that my pizza was taken out of the oven at 6:27 and ""quality checked"". My order was delivered at 6:52pm. Upon opening the box, my pizza came to me in pieces and had oregano on it. I WILL NOT eat pieces of pizza. It was cut into squares. "
299t"I ordered garlic knots as a late night snack, since Domino's is the only local food joint nearby that is open late. After eating the garlic knots, that barely had garlic flavor, I became sick. I found myself hallucinating and quite doped out. This does not happen when I eat. I feel cheated and am concerned about the sanitary environment of Domino's; as well as drugged suspicion."
300t"Do NOT go to the Domino's Pizza store in Hoover Alabama on Lorna Road!!! I repeat, do NOT go there!!! I ordered the coupon special of 2 medium pizzas. One thin for my wife and a medium pepperoni special with mushrooms for me. When I got home there were NO mushrooms and I paid $9.95 for a medium. I called to let them know there were no mushrooms. They do NOT answer the phone!!! While on hold, I am hearing that I can get a large 3 topping pizza for $7.99 each. What a ripoff and remember, I paid $9.95 for something less."
301t"Just an FYI. The $3.99 to $4.99 delivery charge is not for the driver/ delivery person. The company keeps it. This is terrible as I thought it was part of their tip. Domino’s should be ashamed of themselves."
302t"The app/website is always working properly when I’m using it to make a purchase. I log in fine and have no issues. Anytime I attempt to redeem the pizza I’ve earned I am met with utter disappointment. When I open the app I'm always logged in, when I select to redeem a pizza it says verify your password. This is where the circle of death starts. You enter in your password and it either says incorrect or account locked. You hit reset password, no email is sent. This goes on and on for the better part of 20mins or until you give up. If you don’t want people to redeem the free pizza then simply do offer it."
303t"Hello, I have placed an order from Domino's app today, the delivery person cancelled the order and ruined the happiness which we are going to celebrate, when I tried to call the outlet manager they told me they have some policies under which a delivery person (Mr. **) can cancel the delivery without customer confirmation, how can a delivery person has the authority to cancel the order. Also, the delivery boy has unprofessional behaviour on the call after asking, ""Why you have cancelled the order."" "
304t"They make customer foolish.. Very bad taste. Stomach infection. Very very bad totally. Money wastage. Many customers in front me who did order return without food because they were not able to give timely. So poor quality."
305t"Ordered pizza and garlic bread like usual and the food was left on the ground and covered with ants! We never gave instructions to leave pizza on porch! Was given another pizza and never even ate it! Very disappointing!"
306t"I ordered Domino's delivery online and was offered a coupon. I added my delivery information when prompted. During the process I was offered one add-on for a discount under the coupon. When I got to check-out, it said I could not add-on and the price went from $5.99 + whatever the add-on was, to $26.24. I was hungry I proceeded unhappily. The site offered status of my order with choices. I Amazon Alexa. Alexa confirmed."
307t"I ordered pizza for my family. Not only was the pizza never delivered but the money was taken out of my account not once but twice! Called and spoke to the manager who yelled at me because so many people where had called and I was the one that got it even though I was saying it's ok, it's not your fault! But being that everyone who had called was so ignorant by the time I called it was, I have been seeing you calling and I'm trying to fix the problem. What else do I want me to do.... And I'm saying it's ok, calm down, you're fine, she is yelling and yeah my door slammed and she got the momma bear!! I have yet to get a call or my money or food. Dominos wtf my Money"
308t"I called to complain. I was told I would get a replacement. But the employee did not put in a book. So I m told. When I called for a replacement they told me there is no record and too bad for me. They do keep word not. Don't go there!"
309t"Their customer service is nonexistent. Have been writing to them for over a month as I never received the $3.00 tip advertised on TV. Only response I got was ""order timed out"". Won't even tell me what that means. It's too bad as they have a good product but for $3.00 they will not see me in any of their stores!"
310t"Received unlawful and bad service. Wrote to Dominos Corp around 3/16/2022. No reply as of yet. Please see below. It's definitely ground for a legal action.I have few coupons from SaveAround coupon book that I had been purchasing for the last 10 or so years to support local High Schools. One of the coupons that the book has is from Domino’s (buy any, one or more toping large pizza, and get another free of equal or lesser value), and there’s no restriction whatsoever. Besides buying other stuff throughout the year from Domino’s, I had been using this coupon to buy one spatiality pizza (it has more than one topping) at the regular menu price and get another one for free as indicated."
311t"Call the West Main Street Domino's in Meriden Connecticut and order a large pepperoni pizza and when I get there they were arguing with me that it was a medium pepperoni. Wrong. The lady who I even spoke with said my order back to me. They claim they record calls. Well check my call recording. I'm pissed. This place in Meriden is such a joke. They need to learn to hire people that know how to do their job."
312t"I ordered pizza online for pickup. When I came into the store the pizza was already done. I paid my bill. There were four people standing around the guy that took my money, walked away and then I waited for 10 minutes until an employee that worked all the time noticed that the pizza was not given to me. What a bad customer service and the poor lady that was working while all the other guys were just standing around doing nothing."
313t"Well, that massive and creative marketing campaign about a $3 tip isn't really a tip. Domino's saves on gas and employees, but you don't save anything unless you are buying pizza every 7 days. Yep, your ""tip"" expires in 7 days. Isn't this false or misleading advertising? If I give a driver $3 tip, does it just disappear from his/her pocket in 3 days (probably, but you know what I mean)?"
314t"Welp!! I didn't get my wings I so badly wanted at the time. Too bad I can't post my pictures. HIGHLY disappointed. 2 large hand tossed, bread twist, 8pc WINGS PLAIN, 2 2-liters... Got everything right but THE WINGS!! Gave me two boxes of Garlic Bread twist."
315t"Ordered from Dominoes in FT Lauderdale FL Online. Oder said processing, two hours later card was charged and site still said prepping order. Tried to call store and sat on hold for an hour. WORST service I have ever had would not recommend to Anyone."
316t"AUSTIN IN CASTLE HAYNE NC HAS A VERY RUDE AND NEGATIVE ATTITUDE WITH REPEAT CUSTOMERS. VERY BAD. PLEASE LET HIM GO. He refuses to give out his name. Will NOT give out corporate phone number for fear of being reported. He told his employees not to give out manager name or corporate phone number, that if I want corporate number I have to go to store."
317t"I used to order as a last resort when starving. But pizza has gotten saltier and saltier. Pure salt. But what really turned me off from the company is how they just went on an attack in the delivery drivers by promoting to tip the customer $3 if they pick up their own food. They always charge ridiculous made up fees. False advertise on prices. Always mess up orders. Bad on the phone. But to see that they don’t even care or take care of their own workers sealed it. Never again I give them business."
318t"Ordered a large pizza well done and it was burnt black on edges and sausage was too hard and black also. Took a piece back to verify and manager said this is what well done looks like. I have ordered this before and it has never been like this. Pizza was inedible! New manager does not know what pizza should look like. Very poor customer service!"
319t"No don't. Gave me headache and puked on eating. Order placed yesterday and gave me stale food and I got sick and puked. The whole order is in garbage. Even the garbage disposal service is asking of 100 units to dispose on top of 400 units paid for. And needless to say got to bed hungry."
320t"Whoever changed the prices recently, I just want to talk. Example: the chocolate lava cakes use to be $3.99 for 2. Now they're $6.99 for 3. So you get 1 more cake and have to pay the same price for 2 twice. I don't know. Maybe it's just me loving food too much, but that's unfair to me and I'm disappointed. Haha."
321t"I had been a long time Domino's customer until yesterday. I ordered pizza and was called informing me that the delivery was near. I informed the driver that I was on my way downstairs to receive the delivery. I waited and no delivery. I called the store upset that I had not received my pizza and was hung up on because they did not like my tone. I rode by bike down to the store and informed a manager of the situation. He stated that the driver had made several calls - untrue and that the pizza was left at the building entrance - untrue. I received a text with a photo of a building entrance that is not mine. I became more upset explaining the situation and was asked to leave the store. This is not the first time I have experienced delivery problems. At any rate, this company has lost a 30 year customer. Shop Pizza Hut or Papa John's. Forget Domino's, I will!"
322t"BRING BACK THE CHEESEBURGER PIZZA!! Please..My husband and I really wanted the pizza the other day and were super excited to get it delivered to our house. Turn out that you guys no longer make that pizza. Made us super upset. We want it back. I'm sure a lot of people want it back too. So Please Please bring it back."
323t"My wife and I have alternated Domino's and Pizza Hut for the past few years, but we are done with Domino's. She orders a thin crust w/ Italian sausage (normal). I order pan w/ extra sausage. I ALWAYS end up with about 1/3 of hers. I prefer their taste, but I feel like I am getting cheated every time - paying extra for much less. I've taken pics the last few times but they are too big to upload and it's pathetic."
324t"They keep saying they are making changes....Well it is WAY worse here. When the driver showed up with the food he only had less than half, I asked why thinking he would say it's in the car.... No. With the receipt in hand..the store I thought I got it all.... 3 boxes well there were 4 more. Had to wait 20 more min for the rest. While we waited we had a slice and I take it they are over stock in pepperoni and under in cheese. Horrible. I wasted over 100$ and 20$ tip ahead."
325t"Tonight I ordered from store #8841 I order a pizza and pasta and a 2 liter drink, after a hour and 20 mins we called the store and the manager said check to see if your neighbor has your order. We don’t live in a projects. We live in a very nice and upkeep neighborhood so I went to the door. My food was placed on the porch not steps and nobody rang nor called to let us know they were there. His excuse was the driver was going home not a good excuse for me to know I paid 28.67 and got the worst service and the manager wasn’t good at customer service. He kept giving a excuse that they should have rang the door bell but they didn’t. Well the food was ice cold like the soda was sitting on cement. "
326t"These people now started robbery, I placed order, and not delivered even after 1hr, they not even informed me that they will be late, when I called delivery boy he says ""I can't assure when can I come,"" and another strange is my order says delivered in the app."
327t"I ordered online to have my order delivered. Once they delivered a food item was missing. I called and the person said he was the manager and was very rude. He would not give his name and I tried to tell him what was missing by reading the item from the receipt. He refused to hear what I was reading off receipt. I asked for his superior, he refused. I said I would complain he said go ahead. And hung up on me. "
328t"Store 12693 main st suite 240 Hesperia. I had a problem with my order and I called to the restaurant and talked to the manager **. She was so great and fixed my problem so smoothly. I really did appreciate how nice they solved my problem."
329t"Food ordered. We're 10 minutes away from the store and it takes 45 minutes to an HOUR for the food to finally get to us. Pizza is always under or overcooked. They take no concern about gluten or dairy allergies. I don't know why people even like it. It's horrendous."
330t"Due to some delivery issues, I did not get my order and the delivery agent marked it as not contactable. But the manager, Aman, ensures that it reached me within 15 mins. You should have more employees like him. Give him a raise!"
331t"Last month I ordered online, waited 3 hours, called several times, and when the driver arrived he delivered my meal next door to my neighbor. Granted it's not their fault about the bad neighbor but I did try and catch the driver while he was next door, called the store to complain, and filed complaint with corporate with no response. This time I went in store and ordered, waited 30 minutes listening to the workers discuss gays, rednecks, and what they like and don't like. Food handed to me and inspected. Pizza burnt, given not completely and or correctly cooked, and no sauce for dessert. They offered to replace fresh but this was going to be another 45 minutes. Called complaint line and still no answer after 2 days. Never again :( Oh and the meal was just over 50 dollars and I took pictures."
332t"Ordered a pizza delivery online. Pizza tracker indicates pizza is done and 45 minutes later it’s finally out for delivery. Delivery took 35 minutes even though I’m 5 minutes from the store. Pizza was COLD. Called the manager at the store and she was unconcerned. The we make it right option on the app is a joke. This is their response “We are unable to guarantee delivery times.” Fenton MO Store. Scott **. Customer Service Associate. MBR Management/dba Domino's."
333t"Walked in yesterday evening to get pizza and wings. It took 10 minutes for the guy at the register to enter and charge me for the order. No price list anywhere in the store. Food disgusting, missing dip that is included in the price."
334t"I just had a pizza from Domino’s and usually it is $ 7.99. However I was charged $18.24 this evening. So when I questioned the cashier 4735 he was rude and said I have to do online in order to get that price. I tried to explain him that I always pay at the cashier $ 7.99 why this time price is high and I even asked him, ""Have you guys raised the price."" He said, ""No and this is what You have to pay."" I never ever go to Pickerington (Columbus, Ohio) Domino’s Pizza."
335t"Tried to order double pepperoni on the 5.99$ special. Only gives option for extra. Called Domino's, they can't take order on phone. Only through website. Confirmed with employee extra is not double toppings. YOU ARE NOT TRULY GETTING 2 TOPPINGS FOR 5.99!!!!"
336t"Very happy with service. Workers are nice. Food is always warm and well prepared. My go to one is Smithtown. Curbside and store pickup are always spot on. I would recommend this store to anyone. My favorite is the specialty pie."
337t"I've ordered hundreds of Domino's pizzas over the past 15 yrs! At one point I ate 1 everyday for over a month. Not sure what's going on, but they seem to be slacking on giving customers what they order... My last 5 orders, I've ordered triple cheese and had not received it even after complaining to to the franchise and receiving a free pizza for not getting triple cheese... I wonder how often this happens! I'm guessing to save money, the franchises are cheaping out and giving regular cheese when YOU order extra or triple cheese! This is stealing from customers!! I've pretty much lost all hope in dominos and will be spending my moneys in places that give me what I order, I suggest YOU do the same."
338t"I placed an order online & was charged $32. When the order was almost complete I get to the store and they tell me the order was cancelled because it was slow night & they had to close. Unprofessional."
339t"This is the incident that happened today Feb 6th. My bf placed an online order #27 at the store on Church Street in Concord. He gave me a copy of his online receipt given by Domino that he had been paid since Feb 5th. Later my Godmother went there to pick it up for me, but the ticket showed was not paid. He told me that they had charged on his credit card. He has been ordered to the same locations two times as one for my birthday, the other time for some holiday. This never happened before."
340t"If I can give they them 0 stars I would. 1st of all they messed up my order, I called. That way they won't mess up. I order 2 pizza and ended up with one. The pizza was not cut into slices. The chicken wings were not cooked. More like raw. I order ginger ale received coke. I usually order from Village Pizza a party size for 30 but decided to try something different. I ended spending 50 on an order that was not even worth the money.. When I called to complain all they can say is, ""What do you want me to do?"" SMH. Awful customer service. DON'T ORDER FROM DOMINO'S!!!"
341t"I hadn't had Domino's in probably over a decade but friend was feeling nostalgic so we ordered pizza and wings. The garlic parm wings were almost inedible, swimming in a cream sauce and with almost no meat. So coated they kept slipping out of my hand. It looked like a dry rub in the picture on my phone or i wouldn't have ordered them. The pizza was underwhelming, good texture but very bland. It'll probably be another decade before someone convinces me to eat Domino's again."
342t"Don't get me wrong I love Domino's Pizza but having to wait 1 hour for a pizza is crazy then when I get the pizza it isn't even fresh. I get they have to do other delivers but having to wait that long is crazy. My suggestion is to hire more people. Sorry if I sound like a Karren but it's just crazy. Even though they take a long time I still like the pizza."
343t"The food was late and we had to microwave it which defeats the purpose of ordering out! The cookie brownie was burnt! The worst $70 spent on 2 small pizzas and 1 medium with the cookie brownie and I gave a 9 or 10 tip!"
344t"Last time I had delivery I asked for contact delivery and when the driver showed up he knocked and would not leave until I had to open the door. This evening I ordered delivery again, the tracker went from checking order to delivery back to checking order. Finally said out for delivery again and took 20 minutes, it’s a four minute drive to my house!!! The pizza was not hot!!!! What the heck???"
345t"I bought this bake dish because I like cheese. The cheese is greasy and disgusting. It left an after in my mouth. Dominos did not bake it as specified. It is a runny tasteless powder cheese. The so call baked cheese comes with garlic bread. The bread was not fresh. Do not buy it."
346t"It was around 6pm on 01/21/2022 I went in to Domino's on 6600 West Teutonia Ave in Milwaukee WI and place two orders. One for Pat that contain a medium pizza with sausage, pepperonis, black olives, green peppers and onions with a 10 piece hot wings that total to $26 and some cents and one for Lee was a medium with sausage and pepperonis and a ten piece BBQ.... However I did not get my order or my money for the order for Pat. "
347t"Their discount program for $7.99 is really bogus. They charged me over $11.00 for it. Toppings are like dog food. The sausage is all ground up and Pizza has a funny taste. On top of that the Pizza was cold even though I picked it up at the store right away. I went back to the store and that same night and they did refund my money. But it ruined my dinner."
348t"Absolutely love the value with their ""buy at least two"" deal going on. I save a lot of money's and it's easy to sell at work. Plus, I get a free pizza every now and then using my points. How awesome is that? I rarely give my business to anyone else when it comes to pizza."
349t"I ordered 2 pizza but only 1 was ordered, the one I got was cold, burnt and salty. It taste horrible. I can honestly say it's the worst pizza I ever had. After calling the store I was told they would send the other pizza."
350t"We ordered 3 specialty pizzas from Domino's. Spent 70.00, hardly had any crust, sauce and topping on all three pizzas. Very very disappointing. My whole family and myself believe that frozen pizza would have surpassed the quality of product from Domino's."
